The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8(+) T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2(high) CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models. Our findings collectively illustrate that PAI-1-induced SFRP2(high) CAFs serve as critical stromal regulator to hijack the abscopal effect, providing promising targets for enhancing radioimmunotherapy effectiveness.

Our findings delineate key mechanistic steps involving IP3R2 engagement and Ca(2+) flux, governing interleukin-25 (IL-25) production by tuft cells triggered by succinate detection. While IL-17RB has a pivotal intrinsic role in ILC2 activation, it exerts a regulatory function in tuft cells. Tuft cells exhibit constitutive Il25 expression, placing them in an anticipatory state that facilitates rapid production of IL-25 protein for ILC2 activation. Tuft cell IL-17RB is crucial for restraining IL-25 bioavailability, preventing excessive tonic ILC2 stimulation due to basal Il25 expression. Supraoptimal ILC2 stimulation by IL-25 resulting from tuft cell Il17rb deficiency or prolonged succinate exposure induces a state of hypoproliferation in ILC2s, also observed in chronic helminth infection. Our study offers critical insights into the regulatory dynamics of IL-25 in this circuit, highlighting the delicate tuning required for responses to diverse luminal states. ",Nature immunology,

Radiation injury depletes proliferative intestinal stem cells (ISCs); in response to this, the epithelium activates a regenerative program that facilitates the healing of the intestine. However, the mechanisms that induce the activation of the intestinal regenerative program are poorly characterized. METHODS: In this study, we induced radiation-induced enteritis in mice through abdominal irradiation, mimicking clinical scenarios. Through imaging and flow cytometric analysis, we investigated the recruitment of macrophages to the small intestine during injury and healing. Additionally, we developed a co-culture system for mouse and human intestinal organoids and macrophages to explore the crosstalk between these cells. Then combining in vivo ablation of macrophages, fluorescent lineage tracing, imaging, bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), human intestinal organoids and cell trajectory analysis, we study at cellular and molecular level the macrophage induction of intestinal regeneration. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that macrophages are recruited around the intestinal stem cell compartment upon radiation injury, promoting a fetal-like reprogramming and proliferation of epithelial cells that drives the regeneration process. In contrast macrophage ablation led to compromised regeneration. Moreover, our scRNA-seq analysis identified key secreted molecules, nrg1 and spp1, as pivotal players in regulating this process. Additionally, characterization of human macrophage/organoid co-cultures and cell trajectory inference confirmed the conservation of macrophages' role in triggering the regenerative program in primary human cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies macrophages as essential contributors to intestinal regeneration beyond their innate immune response. Targeting macrophages therapeutically may hold promise in enhancing regeneration and improving the quality of life for cancer survivors. ",Gastroenterology,

The enduring consequences of these earthquakes on daily life triggered widespread fears and anxieties in society, leading to scholarly investigations in this field. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to create and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Fear of Earthquake Scale (FES), a modified adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19 S), tailored to measure earthquake-related experiences in Türkiye. METHODS: A total of 315 Turkish adult participants (106 men, 209 women), with a mean age of 37.71 years, completed the FES, along with the Brief Psychological Resilience Scale (BPRS). Psychometric analyses included confirmatory factor analysis as well as the evaluation of alternative factor structures, internal consistency, convergent validity, and criterion validity with respect to resilience. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the Turkish version of the Fear of Earthquake Scale has strong psychometric properties in terms of validity and reliability. After assessing various factor structures, it was observed that the two-factor model which represents the emotional and somatic response to fear, exhibited the best-fit values The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated as 0.89 for the overall FES, 0.84 for the emotional subscale and 0.86 for the somatic subscale, indicating high internal consistency. Additionally, the negative correlation between resilience and the FES supports the criterion validity of the scale, and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses proved that measurement invariance held across genders and whether they experienced an earthquake or not for all groups. Furthermore, the results of the study revealed that women and individuals with prior earthquake experience reported higher levels of fear of earthquakes. CONCLUSIONS: The FES emerged as a reliable and valid tool for assessing earthquake-related fears among the Turkish population. ",BMC psychology,

Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front.

This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive profile, mental health, and quality of life in patients with chronic and episodic migraine during the interictal period, and to explore their relationship with sociodemographic and clinical variables. METHOD: This observational, descriptive, cross-sectional analytical study included 60 patients diagnosed with chronic or episodic migraine, who were enrolled in a health program for headache patients between 2010 and 2016. Cognitive function, anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and quality of life during the interictal period were assessed. Descriptive analyses were conducted, and associations were evaluated by configuring primary (type of migraine) and alternative events (cognitive impairment, depression and/or anxiety, and poor quality of life). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 45 years (SD ± 8), with 83.3% being women and 93.3% belonging to middle and low socioeconomic strata. Of the 60 patients, 83.3% (50) were diagnosed with chronic migraine, while the remaining had episodic migraine. The use of one or more cognition-altering medications was observed in 90% of patients with chronic migraine and 60% of those with episodic migraine (p = 0.02). Anxiety was more prevalent in patients with episodic migraine, whereas depression was more common among those with chronic migraine. Female gender, middle socioeconomic status, and longer disease duration were significantly associated with chronic migraine. Among the 57 patients who completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, 38.6% had cognitive impairment, which decreased with longer migraine duration and better social interaction. Memory and selective attention were the most affected cognitive domains in both groups. No significant associations were found for the other variables after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic migraine significantly impacts mental health, cognition, and quality of life, with depression and cognitive impairments being prevalent. Social interaction and longer disease duration may protect against cognitive decline, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary, personalized interventions addressing neurological and psychosocial challenges.

In this study, we performed integrated chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic analyses using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on twenty pairs of prostate cancer and matched benign tissues. By incorporating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data, we identified a subset of differentially expressed eRNAs significantly associated with genes involved in prostate development and oncogenic signaling pathways. Among these, lactotransferrin-eRNA (LTFe) was markedly downregulated in prostate cancer tissues, with functional analyses revealing its tumor-suppressive role. Mechanistically, LTFe promotes the transcription of its target gene, lactotransferrin (LTF), by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (HNRNPF) and facilitating enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LTFe-LTF axis facilitates ferroptosis by modulating iron transport. Notably, androgen receptor (AR) signaling disrupts LTFe-associated chromatin looping, leading to ferroptosis resistance. Therapeutically, co- administration of the AR inhibitor enzalutamide and the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 significantly suppressed tumor growth, offering a promising strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the mechanistic role of eRNAs in prostate cancer, highlighting the LTFe-LTF axis as a critical epigenetic regulator and potential therapeutic target for improved treatment outcomes.

We aimed to improve the diagnosis and early management of patients admitted to hospital (adults aged 16 years and older and children aged >28 days) with suspected acute brain infections at 13 hospitals in Brazil, India, and Malawi. METHODS: With hospital stakeholders, policy makers, and patient and public representatives, we co-designed a multifaceted clinical and laboratory intervention, informed by an evaluation of routine practice. The intervention, tailored for each setting, included a diagnostic and management algorithm, a lumbar puncture pack, a testing panel, and staff training. We used multivariable logistic regression and interrupted time series analysis to compare the coprimary outcomes-the percentage of patients achieving a syndromic diagnosis and the percentage achieving a microbiological diagnosis before and after the intervention. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04190303) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2021, and Nov 30, 2022, we screened 10 462 patients and enrolled a total of 2233 patients at 13 hospital sites connected to the four study centres in Brazil, India, and Malawi. 1376 (62%) were recruited before the intervention and 857 (38%) were recruited after the intervention. 2154 patients (96%) had assessment of the primary outcome (1330 [62%] patients recruited pre-intervention and 824 [38%] recruited post-intervention). The median age across centres was 23 years (IQR 6-44), with 1276 (59%) being adults aged 16 years or older and 888 (41%) children aged between 29 days and 15 years; 1264 (59%) patients were male and 890 (41%) were female. Data on race and ethnicity were not recorded. 1020 (77%) of 1320 patients received a syndromic diagnosis before the intervention, rising to 701 (86%) of 813 after the intervention (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·81 [95% CI 1·40-2·34]; p<0·0001). A microbiological diagnosis was made in 294 (22%) of 1330 patients pre-intervention, increasing to 250 (30%) of 824 patients post-intervention (aOR 1·46 [95% CI 1·18-1·79]; p=0·00040). Interrupted time series analysis confirmed that these increases exceeded a modest underlying trend of improvement over time. The percentage receiving a lumbar puncture, time to appropriate therapy, and functional outcome also improved.

In this study, mice colitis was induced by sodium dextran sulfate and treated with oral IPA. RAW264.7 cells were induced by LPS to polarize into M1 macrophages and treated with IPA. The results showed that IPA could improve colitis by inhibiting M1 polarization of colonic macrophages and promoting M2 polarization. The inhibition of IPA on M1 macrophages was verified in vitro through JNK/MAPK pathway, which inhibited the glycolysis of macrophages. IPA promotes macrophage M2 polarization and enhances fatty acid oxidation through upregulating of CPT1A and ACSL1, which may be related to the activation of PPAR-γ. In summary, IPA can improve colitis by regulating macrophage glucose and lipid metabolism, and targeting intestinal macrophage metabolism may be an effective target for the treatment of UC.

At the preplanned interim analysis, median PFS was significantly longer with ivonescimab than with pembrolizumab (11·1 vs 5·8 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·51 [95% CI 0·38-0·69]; one-sided p<0·0001). The PFS benefit of ivonescimab over pembrolizumab was broadly consistent within prespecified subgroups, including patients with PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) 1-49% (HR 0·54 [95% CI 0·37-0·78]) and PD-L1 TPS of 50% of higher (HR 0·48 [0·29-0·79]). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58 (29%) patients with ivonescimab and 31 (16%) patients with pembrolizumab. Immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed in 14 (7%) of 197 patients on ivonescimab and 16 (8%) of 199 patients on pembrolizumab. Ivonescimab demonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were comparable between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Ivonescimab significantly improved PFS compared with pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with advanced PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, ivonescimab might represent another treatment option in the first-line setting for PD-L1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. FUNDING: Akeso Biopharma.

Imagine instead a carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond positioned tightly over the π cloud of an aryl ring-such an orthogonal, noncovalent arrangement could instead stabilize a positively charged arene intermediate or transition state, giving rise to novel electrophilic aromatic substitution chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis and study of molecule 1, containing a rigid C-F⋅⋅⋅Ar interaction that plays a prominent role in both its reaction chemistry and spectroscopy. For example, we established that the C-F⋅⋅⋅Ar interaction can bring about a >1500 fold increase in the relative rate of an aromatic nitration reaction, affording functionalization on the activated ring exclusively.

To date, the understanding of the molecular and genomic heterogeneity of HGSC is based primarily on the evaluation of tumors from White individuals. In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing on HGSC samples from 211 Black patients to identify significantly mutated genes and characterize mutational signatures, assessing their distributions by gene expression subtypes. The occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations and signatures by self-reported race were compared to historical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Despite technical differences (e.g., formalin-fixed vs. fresh-frozen tissue), the distribution of mutations and their variant classifications for major HGSC genes were nearly identical across study populations. However, de novo significantly mutated gene analysis identified genes not previously reported in the TCGA analysis, including the oncogene KRAS and the potential tumor suppressor OBSCN. The prevalence of the homologous recombination deficiency signature was higher among Black individuals with the immunoreactive gene expression subtype compared with the mesenchymal and proliferative subtypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the data from Black patients to 123 White patients with identical tissue collection and processing. Overall, this study suggests that, while most features of HGSC tumor phenotypes are similar in Black and White populations, there may be clinically-relevant differences. If validated, these phenotypes may be important for clinical decision-making and would have been missed by characterizing tumors from White individuals only. ",Cancer research,

","Neurath, Markus F, Artis, David, Becker, Christoph","The intestinal barrier serves as a boundary between the mucosal immune system in the lamina propria and the external environment of the intestinal lumen, which contains a diverse array of microorganisms and ingested environmental factors, including pathogens, food antigens, toxins, and other foreign substances. This barrier has a central role in regulating the controlled interaction between luminal factors and the intestinal immune system. Disruptions of intestinal epithelial cells, which serve as a physical barrier, or the antimicrobial peptides and mucins they produce, which act as a chemical barrier, can lead to a leaky gut. In this state, the intestinal wall is unable to efficiently separate the intestinal flora and luminal contents from the intestinal immune system. The subsequent activation of the immune system has an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, as well as in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and colorectal cancer. Dysregulated intestinal barrier integrity has also been described in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract, including rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanistic studies of barrier dysfunction have revealed that the subsequent local activation and systemic circulation of activated immune cells and the cytokines they secrete, as well as extracellular vesicles, promote proinflammatory processes within and outside the gastrointestinal tract. In this Review, we summarise these findings and highlight several new therapeutic concepts currently being developed that attempt to control inflammatory processes via direct or indirect modulation of intestinal barrier function.

Oral mizoribine may be an alternative for induction therapy of lupus nephritis. However, large-scale, long-term, randomized clinical studies of mizoribine are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral mizoribine vs intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for Chinese patients with lupus nephritis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial recruited patients with class III, III+V, IV, IV+V, or V lupus nephritis aged 18 to 70 years from 40 centers in China.

INTERVENTIONS: Oral mizoribine (50 mg, 3 times a day) or cyclophosphamide (6 intravenous doses at 0.5-1.0 g/m2 body surface area, with a maximum dose of 1.0 g/d) for 52 weeks plus oral glucocorticoid. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total remission rate (complete remission rate plus partial remission rate) after 52 weeks (prespecified). RESULTS: A total of 250 patients were randomized, and 243 patients (mean [SD] age, 34.6 [10.7] years, 213 women [87.7%]) were treated (123 patients [50.6%] in the mizoribine group and 120 patients [49.4%] in the cyclophosphamide group). The total remission rate at 52 weeks was 66.1% (76 of 115 patients) in the mizoribine group and 76.8% (86 of 112 patients) in the cyclophosphamide group, and the relative risk ratio (mizoribine vs cyclophosphamide) was 0.861 (95% CI, 0.729-1.016). The lower limit of this 2-sided 95% CI was greater than the noninferiority margin of 0.726, indicating that mizoribine was noninferior to cyclophosphamide. Changes in other immune parameters and kidney function were generally similar between the groups. The incidence of any treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events was 80.5% (99 of 123 patients) in the mizoribine group and 78.7% (96 of 122 patients) in the cyclophosphamide group, and the most frequent adverse event in both groups was upper respiratory tract infection (41 patients [33.3%] and 37 patients [30.3%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial shows that compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide, oral mizoribine was noninferior and well tolerated when used with glucocorticoid for induction therapy of active lupus nephritis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ferroptosis of nasal epithelial cell and its implications in the pathogenesis of NPs. METHODS: The cell death, lipid peroxidation, and ferrous iron levels in nasal epithelial cells were determined by flow cytometry. Biomarkers and signaling pathways associated with ferroptosis were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting. Human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and 16HBE cells were stimulated with different agents. Mitochondrial ultrastructure in HNECs were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Cytokine levels were quantified using ELISA. A cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced mouse model was established and treated with deferoxamine. RESULTS: Nasal epithelial cells from both eosinophilic and noneosinophilic NPs showed intensified lipid peroxidation and altered mitochondrial morphology, resembling the features of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis triggered C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL)8 production in 16HBE cells and HNECs through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CSE exposure elevated ferrous iron levels by upregulating transferrin receptor 1, led to ferroptosis and subsequent CXCL8 production in HNECs.

The gut microbiome influences body fat accumulation, but the mechanisms remain to be investigated. Here, we show an association between microbial aromatic amino acid metabolites in serum and body fat accumulation in a large Chinese longitudinal cohort.

These metabolites act on intestinal mucosa to regulate the immune response and control lipid uptake, which protects against obesity. We further demonstrate that T cells and B cells are not vital for 4HPAA-mediated obesity prevention, and innate lymphoid cells have antagonistic roles. Together, these findings reveal specific microbial metabolites as pivotal molecules to prohibit obesity through immune control, establishing mechanisms of host modulation by gut microbial metabolites.

Fully understanding the cellular heterogeneity and immune adaptations in response to anti-PD-1 therapy is necessary to design more effective immunotherapies for GBM. This study aimed to dissect the molecular mechanisms of specific immunosuppressive subpopulations to drive anti-PD-1 resistance in GBM. METHODS: We systematically analysed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data from GBM tissues receiving anti-PD-1 therapy to characterize the microenvironment alterations. The biological functions of a novel circular RNA (circRNA) were validated both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, co-immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were conducted. RESULTS: Mesenchymal GBM (MES-GBM) cells, which were associated with a poor prognosis, and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)(+) myeloid-derived macrophages (SPP1(+) MDMs), a unique subpopulation of MDMs with complex functions, preferentially accumulated in non-responders to anti-PD-1 therapy, indicating that MES-GBM cells and SPP1(+) MDMs were the main anti-PD-1-resistant cell subpopulations. Functionally, we determined that circular RNA succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (circSDHAF2), which was positively associated with the abundance of these two anti-PD-1-resistant cell subpopulations, facilitated the formation of a regional MES-GBM and SPP1(+) MDM cell interaction loop, resulting in a spatially specific adaptive immunosuppressive microenvironment. Mechanically, we found that circSDHAF2 promoted MES-GBM cell formation by stabilizing the integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) protein through N-glycosylation. Meanwhile, the N-glycosylation of the ITGA5 protein facilitated its translocation into exosomes and subsequent delivery to MDMs to induce the formation of SPP1(+) MDMs, which in turn maintained the MES-GBM cell status and induced T-cell dysfunction via the SPP1-ITGA5 pathway, ultimately promoting GBM immune escape. Importantly, our findings demonstrated that antibody-mediated ITGA5 blockade enhanced anti-PD-1-mediated antitumor immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This work elucidated the potential tissue adaptation mechanism of intratumoral dynamic interactions between MES-GBM cells, MDMs and T cells in anti-PD-1 non-responders and identified the therapeutic potential of targeting ITGA5 to reduce anti-PD-1 resistance in GBM.

However, disease relapse is still common, and the mechanism of resistance remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on MM samples from 10 patients who relapsed after GPRC5D CAR T-cell therapy. Among these patients, 8 had GPRC5D loss, while 2 presented mixed expression (GPRC5D+/-). Genetic alterations were identified in three cases: one had a homozygous deletion in the GPRC5D gene, another had a biallelic loss in the regulatory regions of GPRC5D, and the third had homozygous deletions in both TNFRSF17 and GPRC5D after sequential anti-BCMA and anti-GPRC5D CAR T-cell therapies. No genetic changes were detected at GPRC5D locus in the remaining 7 cases. However, multiple hypermethylation sites were present in the transcriptional regulatory elements of the GPRC5D gene in 5 post-treatment MM samples. In MM cell lines, GPRC5D expression was inversely correlated with methylation levels in its regulatory regions. Furthermore, azacitidine treatment induced GPRC5D mRNA and protein expression in hypermethylated MM cell lines. Our findings highlight that biallelic genetic inactivation and hypermethylation-driven epigenetic silencing are key mechanisms contributing to GPRC5D loss and treatment resistance. ",Blood,

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) represent the common progenitor to myofibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to mediate liver fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of Pre-B-Cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) in this process. METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injection or bile duct ligation (BDL). Cellular transcriptome was examined by RNA-seq and CUT&Tag-seq. RESULTS: PBX1 was screened out of mining through liver fibrosis-related single-cell RNA-seq datasets as the most prominently up-regulated transcription factor during HSC activation. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) coupled with reporter assay and ChIP assay demonstrated that Notch3 mediated elevation of PBX1 expression at the transcriptional level in HSCs. PBX1 knockdown attenuated HSC-myofibroblast transition in vitro and liver fibrosis in mice. Integrated transcriptomic analysis suggested that PBX1 contributed to HSC activation by activating a host of pro-fibrogenic molecules including interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R/CD127). Consistently, exposure to recombinant IL-7 promoted HSC activation whereas IL7R knockdown hampered HSC activation. Mechanistically, IL7R interacted with TGF-β receptors (TβRI/II) to trigger a pro-fibrogenic signaling cascade. Importantly, blockade of the IL-7-IL7R signaling with neutralizing antibodies markedly ameliorated liver fibrosis in mice. Finally, a positive correlation between PBX1, IL7R and HSC activation was identified in cirrhotic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data uncover a previously unappreciated role for PBX1 in HSC activation and provide proof-of-concept for targeting IL-7 signaling in the intervention of liver fibrosis.

This aptamer-based PROTAC platform, termed ZATAC, is facilely produced through bioorthogonal chemistry or self-assembly and shows promise in eliminating several undruggable target proteins, including nucleolin (NCL), SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), and mutant p53-R175H, underscoring its universality and versatility. To specifically deliver ZATACs into cancer cells, we further develop DNA three-way junction-based ZATACs (3WJ-ZATACs) by integrating an additional aptamer that selectively recognizes the protein overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. The 3WJ-ZATACs demonstrate in vivo tumor-specific distribution and achieve dual-target degradation, thereby suppressing tumor growth without causing noticeable toxicity.

Inhibition of p40, a subunit of IL-12/IL-23, attenuates pathology in AD-like mice; however, its signaling mechanism and expression pattern remained elusive. Here we show that IL-12 receptors are predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes in AD-like APPPS1 mice and in patients with AD, whereas IL-23 receptor transcripts are barely detectable. Consistently, deletion of the IL-12 receptor in neuroectodermal cells ameliorated AD pathology in APPPS1 mice, whereas removal of IL-23 receptors had no effect. Genetic ablation of IL-12 signaling alone reverted the loss of mature oligodendrocytes, restored myelin homeostasis, rescued the amyloid-β-dependent reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and restored phagocytosis-related changes in microglia of APPPS1 mice. Furthermore, IL-12 protein expression was increased in human AD brains compared to healthy age-matched controls, and human oligodendrocyte-like cells responded profoundly to IL-12 stimulation. We conclude that oligodendroglial and neuronal IL-12 signaling, but not IL-23 signaling, are key in orchestrating AD-related neuroimmune crosstalk and that IL-12 represents an attractive therapeutic target in AD.

We systematically reviewed Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with two agents to synthesize the comparative efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed electronic databases until December 15, 2024, using selected keywords and Boolean ""AND."" Subsequently, we compared the most closely matched trials conducted with semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide through an adjusted (if baseline imbalance in treatment outcome modifiers present) or unadjusted (in the absence of baseline imbalance) indirect treatment comparison method.

However, only a small subset of CRC patients harboring deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) benefits from ICB therapy. A very limited response to ICB therapy has been achieved in MMR-proficient CRC, representing a significant challenge limiting the clinical application of immunotherapy. MMR is the critical DNA repair pathway that maintains genomic integrity by correcting DNA mismatches, which is mediated by the MutSα or MutSβ complex consisting of MSH2 with MSH6 and MSH3, respectively. Given that MMR status directs effective immune response, we sought to determine whether targeting MMR capacity boosts ICB efficacy. METHODS: Azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC and xenograft model were used to evaluate the function of PRMT6 and response to PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 and combination therapy of PD1 and EPZ020411. Biochemical assays were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of PRMT6-mediated MSH2 methylation and immune evasion. RESULTS: We have identified PRMT6 as a crucial regulator of MMR capacity via MSH2 dimethylation at R171 and R219. Such a modification abrogates its MMR capacity and prevents the recruitment of MSH3 and MSH6. PRMT6 loss or inhibition triggers cytosolic DNA accumulation and cGAS-STING signaling activation, leading to enhanced immune response in PRMT6-deficient colon tumors or xenografts. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 using EPZ020411 promotes mutagenesis and destabilizes MutSα or MutSβ assembly, and prolonged EPZ020411 exposure maintains an MSI-like phenotype in microsatellite stability (MSS) cells. EPZ020411 treatment sensitizes ICB efficacy of MSS cells, but not MSI cells in vivo. Similar effects have been observed in MSS colon tumors induced by AOM/DSS.

Protein ubiquitination plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the possible contribution of the E3 ubiquitin ligase March2 (membrane-associated RING finger protein 2) to the cause of AAD remains elusive. METHODS: Integrated single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was conducted in human AAD tissues. Based on the screening results, we generated a mouse line of smooth muscle cell-specific March2 knockout. β-Aminopropionitrile monofumarate was used to establish AAD. Cleavage under targets and tagmentation and cleavage under targets and tagmentation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to identify possible target genes for histone H3K18 lactylation. RESULTS: March2 expression was downregulated in aorta from patients with AAD or β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate-induced AAD mice. β-Aminopropionitrile monofumarate-induced AAD was significantly accentuated in March2 global (March2(-/-)) and vascular smooth muscle cell-specific deletion (March2(fl/fl); Tagln(Cre)) mice, whereas the AAD pathology was rescued by rAAV9-SM22α-March2 (recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing Flag-tagged March2 under SM22α promoter). March2 interacted with PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) to promote K33-linked polyubiquitination. Deficiency of March2 lessened PKM2 dimer-to-tetramer conversion in AAD and overtly exacerbated AAD-induced histone H3K18 lactylation in vascular smooth muscle cells by fostering glucose metabolism reprogramming, thereby promoting p53-driven apoptotic transcriptional response-a hallmark of AAD pathogenesis. TEPP-46, a PKM2-specific activator, pronouncedly alleviated March2 deficiency-deteriorated AAD pathology.

To address this issue, we imaged VMHdm(SF1) neurons at single-cell resolution in freely behaving mice exposed to a natural predator in varying contexts. Our results reveal that VMHdm(SF1) neurons do not encode different defensive behaviors but rather represent predator identity and multiple predator-evoked internal states, including threat-evoked fear/anxiety, arousal or neophobia, predator imminence, and safety. Notably, threat and safety are encoded bi-directionally by anti-correlated subpopulations.

This rare focal liver disease affects all races and ages, with a predominance of young males. There is an up to 88% association with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the aetiology is unknown and the pathophysiology is poorly understood, PSC is regarded as an autoimmune liver disease based on a strong immunogenetic background. Further, the associated risk for various malignancies, particularly cholangiocellular carcinoma, is also poorly understood. No medical therapy has been approved so far nor has been shown to improve transplant-free survival. However, ursodeoxycholic acid is widely used since it improves the biochemical parameters of cholestasis and is safe at low doses. MRI of the biliary tract is the primary imaging technology for diagnosis. Endoscopic interventions of the bile ducts should be limited to clinically relevant strictures for balloon dilatation, biopsy and brush cytology. End-stage liver disease with decompensation is an indication for liver transplantation with recurrent PSC in up to 38% of patients. Several novel therapeutic strategies are in various stages of development, including apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, integrin inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, CCL24 blockers, recombinant FGF19, CCR2/CCR5 inhibitors, farnesoid X receptor bile acid receptor agonists, and nor-ursodeoxycholic acid.

Probiotics show potential as an adjuvant treatment for URTIs, but evidence in children is limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 in shortening fever duration among children with URTIs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted between November 19, 2021, and June 20, 2023, at the pediatric emergency department of the Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. Patients between 28 days and 4 years of age with a fever (≥38.5 °C) and URTI were eligible. Exclusion criteria included recent probiotic use, chronic autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive treatment, and requirement for hospitalization. Randomization was computer generated and assigned participants to either the intervention (probiotics) or control (placebo) group. Participants, parents or caregivers, and investigators were masked to the group assignments. The primary analysis followed the intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: The probiotic group received daily single dose of 0.5 mL probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 for 14 days. The placebo group received daily single dose of 0.5 mL placebo for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was fever duration, defined as the number of days between the first and the last days with fever. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients enrolled (69 males [54%]; mean [SD] age 2.5 [1.3] years), 65 (51%) were randomly assigned to receive placebo and 63 (49%) to receive probiotics. The median (IQR) fever duration was shorter in the probiotic group than the placebo group (median [IQR], 3 [2-4] days vs 5 [4-6] days; adjusted risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80). Few mild adverse events were reported and did not significantly differ between the probiotic and placebo groups, including constipation (6 [16%] and 6 [12%]; P = .80) and abdominal pain (3 [8%] and 2 [4%]; P = .65). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, administering a probiotic mixture reduced fever duration by 2 days compared with placebo, with no meaningful safety concerns. The probiotic mixture under investigation could be an effective adjuvant for shortening fever duration in children with URTIs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06052540.

METHODS: Prior to hysterectomy for EC or benign indications, women collected vaginal pool samples with intravaginal tampons and underwent endometrial brushing. Specimens underwent pyrosequencing for DNA methylation of genes reported to be hypermethylated in gynecologic cancers and recently identified markers discovered by profiling over 200 ECs. Methylation was evaluated individually across CpGs and averaged across genes. Differences between EC and benign endometrium (BE) were assessed using two-sample t-tests and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Thirty-eight ECs and 28 BEs were included. We evaluated 97 CpGs within 12 genes, including previously reported markers (RASSF1, HSP2A, HOXA9, CDH13, HAAO, and GTF2A1) and those identified in discovery work (ASCL2, HTR1B, NPY, HS3ST2, MME, ADCYAP1, and additional CDH13 CpG sites). Mean methylation was higher in tampon specimens from EC v. BE for 9 of 12 genes (ADCYAP1, ASCL2, CDH13, HS3ST2, HTR1B, MME, HAAO, HOXA9, and RASSF1) (all p<0.05). Among these genes, relative hypermethylation was observed in EC v. BE across CpGs. Endometrial brush and tampon results were similar. Within tampon specimens, AUC was highest for HTR1B (0.82), RASSF1 (0.75), and HOXA9 (0.74). This is the first report of HOXA9 hypermethylation in EC.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that P. falciparum and EBV synergize to induce dysregulated expression of AID. Using flow cytometry, intracellular AID expression was measured in PBMCs from a cohort of children from Western Kenya with uncomplicated malaria and community controls. Children with uncomplicated malaria had elevated levels of CD19+ AID+ B cells compared to controls. This high level of AID was sustained up to 8 weeks after parasite clearance. Using ImageStream flow cytometry, we found that 52% of AID was localized in the nucleus of CD19+ B cells in children with malaria. To test whether EBV and P. falciparum synergized to drive the expression of AID, we stimulated CD19+ B cells with EBV, CpG (to mimic P. falciparum DNA), or BAFF (induced during P. falciparum infection), or as a combination. Individually, EBV, BAFF and CpG induced AID expression. However, when combined, there was a significant increase of ∼30% in the frequency of CD19+AID+ cells above cells treated with EBV, BAFF, or CpG individually. Collectively, these data suggest that P. falciparum malaria and EBV coinfection result in sustained AID expression, potentially influencing the MYC translocation that is characteristic of BL.

Nonetheless, the functional variability of MSCs from different sources complicates their clinical application. Stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) offer advantages such as ease of procurement and robust proliferative capacity, but their secretome, particularly SHED-Exo, remains underexplored in the context of liver disease therapy. This study analyzed MSC-Exo from various sources via small RNA sequencing to identify differences in microRNA profiles, aiding in the selection of optimal MSC sources for clinical use. SHED-Exo was subsequently tested in an acute liver injury model, showing notable regenerative effects, including enhanced hepatocyte proliferation, macrophage polarization, and reduced inflammation. Despite strong liver-targeting properties, the rapid hepatic clearance of SHED-Exo limits its effectiveness in chronic liver diseases. To address this challenge, a GelMA-based hydrogel was developed for in situ delivery, ensuring sustained release and enhanced antifibrotic efficacy, providing a promising strategy for chronic liver disease management.

Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity.

METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, phase 1/2 study was done at six tertiary cancer centres in India. Phase 1 was a single-centre study done in Tata Memorial Hospital, India, in patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas. Phase 2 was a single-arm, multicentre, basket trial done in five tertiary cancer centres in patients aged 15 years and older with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients had a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more, an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (phase 1) or 0-2 (phase 2), and an adequate organ function. Patients underwent apheresis to obtain at least 1 × 10(9) lymphocytes to manufacture CAR T cells. Lymphodepletion therapy was done with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) and fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) for 3 days or bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) for 2 days. Patients were then infused intravenously with talicabtagene autoleucel 1 × 10(7)-5 × 10(9) CAR T cells in a fractionated schedule (10%, 30%, and 60%, on days 0, 1, and 2, respectively) during phase 1 or at least 5 × 10(6) CAR T cells per kg (up to 2 × 10(9) CAR T cells) on day 0 during phase 2. The primary endpoints were safety (phase 1) and overall response rate (phase 2). The efficacy analysis was done in the efficacy evaluable cohort (all patients who received the target dose and 3 days of lymphodepletion therapy). The safety analysis was done in the safety population (all patients who received talicabtagene autoleucel). The trials are registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2021/04/032727 and CTRI/2022/12/048211), and enrolment is closed. FINDINGS: Of 64 patients, 14 were enrolled in phase 1 (from May 11, 2021, to May 13, 2022) and 50 were enrolled in phase 2 (Dec 27, 2022, to Aug 31, 2023). The median age of the overall cohort was 44 years (IQR 27-57), and 49 (77%) of 64 patients were male and 15 (23%) were female. In phase 1, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred at doses of 2 × 10(6)-17 × 10(6) CAR T cells per kg. A dose of at least 5 × 10(6) CAR T cells per kg was chosen for phase 2 based on a complete response in three of seven patients at this dose. The most common grade 3 or worse toxicities were haematological events: anaemia (35 [61%] of 57 patients), thrombocytopenia (37 [65%] patients), neutropenia (55 [96%] patients, and febrile neutropenia (27 [47%]) patients). There were two treatment-related deaths, one due to febrile neutropenia, immune-effector cell associated haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and septic shock, and the second due to pulmonary bleed, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome. In 51 efficacy-evaluable patients (36 with B-cell lymphoma and 15 with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), the overall response rate was 73% (37 of 51; 95% CI 59-83).

MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion(2) and systemic hyperinflammation(3). The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. (4,5)). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.

Investigating these cells revealed a critical threshold of ∼75% deleted genomes, beyond which oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein depletion, metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media were observed. Single-cell multiomic profiling identified two distinct nuclear gene deregulation responses: one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to heteroplasmy. Ultimately, we show that our method enables the modeling of disease-associated mtDNA deletions across cell types and could inform the development of targeted therapies. ",Cell,

","Thompson, Alistair, Calissano, Chiara, Treasure, Janet, Ball, Hannah, Montague, Alice, Ward, Thomas, Cardi, Valentina","BACKGROUND: Patients with anorexia nervosa tend to experience an inner ""eating disorder"" voice. They struggle to recognise and assert their own identity over the illness's identity and relate to it from a powerless and subordinate position. AVATAR therapy was developed to help patients with psychosis to gain greater power and control over distressing voices. The goal of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of an adaptation of AVATAR therapy for anorexia nervosa. METHODS: Twelve adult patients with anorexia nervosa were recruited. Ten completed an assessment session and between five to seven therapy sessions. The assessment session consisted in the creation of an avatar to represent the ""eating disorder"". This was accomplished by manipulating auditory and visual characteristics through a specialist computer software. During the therapy sessions, patients interacted with the avatar to assert their own desires and will. Patients completed baseline, end of intervention and follow-up (4-week) online questionnaires. A non-concurrent multiple baselines single case experimental design (SCED) was used (A(1)BA(2)). Feasibility, acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of the intervention were assessed. RESULTS: The therapy met pre-specified criteria relating to (1) Feasibility: sample recruited within three months; retention rate at the end of the treatment phase = 81.9%; therapy completion rate = 90.1%. (2) Safety: no serious adverse events associated with the intervention. (3) Acceptability: mean ratings = 7.5 (SD = 2.61) out of ten, on a 0-10 scale of acceptability (10 = complete satisfaction). With regards to efficacy, participants reported significantly lower levels of distress associated with the eating disorder voice and higher levels of self-compassion at the end of treatment. No other significant changes were observed in frequency of the eating disorder voice, voice's characteristics, such as omnipotence and malevolence, eating disorder symptoms and symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. Patients' feedback indicated that the therapy had helped with their ability to stand up to the illness, make positive changes around eating, and increase their motivation to recover and self-compassion. CONCLUSION: AVATAR therapy for anorexia nervosa is feasible, acceptable and safe for patients. Larger studies are needed to test clinical efficacy.

We find reduced astrocytes and PTN in the dorsomedial PFC of male mice with depression induced by chronic restraint and social defeat stress. Knockdown of astrocytic PTN induces depression-related responses, which is reversed by exogenous PTN supplementation or overexpression of astrocytic PTN. The antidepressant effects exerted by astrocytic PTN require interaction with PTPRZ1 in excitatory neurons, and PTN-PTPRZ1 activates the AKT signaling pathway to regulate depression-related responses. Our findings indicate the PTN-PTPRZ1-AKT pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for MDD. ",Nature communications,

Consequently, employing human samples-such as whole blood or fractions, valvular and vascular tissues, myocardium, pericardium, or human-derived cells-is essential for enhancing the translational relevance of cardiovascular research. For instance, myocardial tissue slices, which preserve crucial structural and functional characteristics of the human heart, can be used in vitro to examine drug responses. Human blood serves as a rich source of biomarkers, including extracellular vesicles, various types of RNA (miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNAs), circulating inflammatory cells, and endothelial colony-forming cells, facilitating detailed studies of cardiovascular diseases. Primary cardiomyocytes and vascular cells isolated from human tissues are invaluable for mechanistic investigations in vitro. In cases where these are unavailable, human induced pluripotent stem cells serve as effective substitutes, albeit with specific limitations. However, the use of human samples presents challenges such as ethical approvals, tissue procurement and storage, variability in patient genetics and treatment regimens, and the selection of appropriate control samples.

We investigated associations of HLA variants, amino acid polymorphisms, zygosity, and evolutionary divergence (HED) with HBV-related HCC in Han Chinese and explored biological mechanisms. APPROACH RESULTS: We examined the associations of HLA variants (imputed 4-digit classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms), zygosity, and HED with HBV-related HCC in a discovery set (706 HBV-related HCC cases, 6,197 chronic HBV carriers in Taiwan). Significant signals were validated in independent set (636 cases, 560 controls in Qidong, PR China). We used logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, and top 10 genetic principal components, with a Bonferroni-correction for multiple testing (p<1.6×10-4). We evaluated predicted peptide-binding affinities and control of viral load, viral population diversity, and inflammatory markers for significant signals. HLA-DQB1*03:01 was most significantly associated with HBV-related HCC in discovery and validation sets (ORmeta-analysis=1.33, Pmeta-analysis=2.6×10-8). Three amino acids within DQβ1 peptide-binding region, HLA-DQβ1Ala13, HLA-DQβ1Tyr26, and HLA-DQβ1Glu45, were positively associated with HCC. HLA-DQB1*03:01 was associated with lower binding affinity of HBV nucleocapsid antigen and higher HBV DNA load and serum soluble programmed cell death 1 (sPD-1) (P<0.05). HLA-DQB1 heterozygosity was inversely associated with HCC independent of HLA-DQB1*03:01 (Pmeta-analysis=3.3×10-3). CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQB1*03:01 and its three key amino acids are associated with an increased HBV-related HCC risk. This association may be explained by the low binding affinity to HBV antigen, resulting in poor control of viral load and increased inflammation, as evidenced by sPD-1 levels.

The cuproptosis suppression has been characterized in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we reveal that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a driver of cuproptosis resistance in solid tumor. We found that HIF-1α activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and 3 (PDK1/3), resulting in decreased expression of dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) (target of copper), and promotes the accumulation of metallothionein, which sequesters mitochondrial copper, leading to resistance to cuproptosis under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we discovered that high levels of copper reduce ubiquitination and increase the stability of HIF-1α protein without affecting its mRNA levels. Inhibition of HIF-1α increases the susceptibility of cancer to cuproptosis in vivo.

Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived skin organoids (hiPSC-SOs) as a model for EV-A71 infection and find that multiple cell types within the skin organoids, including epidermal cells, hair follicle cells, fibroblasts, and nerve cells, express EV-A71 receptors and are susceptible to EV-A71 infection. We elucidate the specific response of different cell types to EV-A71 and reveal that EV-A71 infection can degrade extracellular collagen and affect fibroblasts. We find that EV-A71 can mediate epidermal cell damage through autophagy and Integrin/Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathways, thereby promoting hyperproliferation of progenitor cells. Based on this finding, we identify an autophagy-associated protein as a drug target of EV-A71 and discover an EV-A71 replication inhibitor.

DL radiomics and pathomics models were developed to predict VETC using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR and pathologic images. Deep radiomics score (DRS) and handcrafted and deep pathomics scores were compared between the group with VETC pattern in HCC (VETC+) and group without VETC pattern in HCC (VETC-). Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors, and the radiopathomics nomogram models were developed for early recurrence and progression-free survival (PFS). The prognostic power was evaluated using the concordance index (C index) and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results In the external test set, the Swin Transformer showed good performance for predicting VETC in both DL radiomics (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.77-0.79) and pathomics (AUC, 0.79) models. Patients with VETC+ HCC had significantly higher DRS and handcrafted and deep pathomics scores compared with patients with VETC- HCC in all datasets (all P < .001). The radiopathomics nomogram model incorporating DRS in the arterial phase and the handcrafted and deep pathomics scores achieved C indexes of 0.69, 0.60, and 0.67 for early recurrence and time-dependent AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.91), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.94), and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.88) for 3-year PFS in the training, internal, and external test sets, respectively.

Oral finasteride has been linked with depression and suicide; however, a causal association is uncertain. The so-called post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) refers to a ""cluster"" of side effects experienced by some men (i.e., cis men) after taking oral finasteride. AIMS: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the association of depression and suicide with oral finasteride in males, using data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). As a secondary objective, we conducted disproportionality analyses of FAERS data to assess whether oral dutasteride use was linked to psychological symptoms related to depression and suicidality. METHODS: We conducted disproportionality analyses for 5 AEs using MedDRA terms. Associations were metricized with the reporting odds ratio (ROR) across 3 time periods, namely, 2006-2011, 2013-2018, and 2019-2023. RESULTS: No significant AEs/signals were detected with oral finasteride from 2006 to 2011 for any of the 5 AEs (completed suicide, depression suicidal, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, attempted suicide). Signals were detected for some AEs during 2013-2018 and 2019-2023.

Targeting KRAS has been complicated by mutational heterogeneity and rapid resistance. We developed a novel pan-RAS inhibitor, ADT-1004 (an oral prodrug of ADT-007) and evaluated antitumor activity in murine and human PDAC models. METHODOLOGY: Murine PDAC cells with KRAS(G12D) mutation (KPC-luc or 2838c3-luc) were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of C57BL/6J mice, and four PDX PDAC tumors with KRAS mutations were implanted subcutaneously in NSG mice. To assess potential to overcome RAS inhibitor resistance, parental and resistant MIA PaCa-2 PDAC cells (KRAS(G12C) mutation) were implanted subcutaneously. Subcutaneously implanted RAS(WT) BxPC-3 cells were used to assess the selectivity of ADT-1004. RESULTS: ADT-1004 potently blocked tumor growth and RAS activation in mouse PDAC models without discernable toxicity with target engagement and reduced activated RAS and ERK phosphorylation. In addition, ADT-1004 suppressed tumor growth in PDX PDAC models with KRAS(G12D), KRAS(G12V), KRAS(G12C), or KRAS(G13Q) mutations and increased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the TME consistent with exhaustion and increased MHCII(+) M1 macrophage and dendritic cells. ADT-1004 demonstrated superior efficacy over sotorasib and adagrasib in tumor models resistant to these KRAS(G12C) inhibitors and MRTX1133 resistant KRAS(G12D) mutant cells. As evidence of selectivity for tumors with mutant KRAS, ADT-1004 did not impact the growth of tumors from RAS(WT) PDAC cells. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: ADT-1004 has strong antitumor activity in aggressive and clinically relevant PDAC models with unique selectivity to block RAS-mediated signaling in RAS mutant cells. As a pan-RAS inhibitor, ADT-1004 has broad activity and potential efficacy advantages over allele-specific KRAS inhibitors. These findings support clinical trials of ADT-1004 for KRAS mutant PDAC.

Key signaling hubs in this network include insulin/IGF-1, AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins. The Hippo/Mammalian Ste20-like Kinase1 (MST1) pathway has been reported to maintain lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, but its role has not been studied in higher metazoans. In this study, we report that overexpression of Hpo, the MST1 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, decreased lifespan with concomitant changes in lipid metabolism and aging-associated gene expression, while RNAi Hpo depletion increased lifespan. These effects were mediated primarily by Hpo-induced transcriptional activation of the RNA-binding protein maternal expression at 31B (Me31b)/RCK, resulting in stabilization of mRNA-encoding a lipolytic hormone, Akh. In mouse adipocytes, Hpo/Mst1 mediated adipocyte differentiation, phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins such as Rck, decapping MRNA 2 (Dcp2), enhancer Of MRNA decapping 3 (Edc3), nucleolin (NCL), and glucagon mRNA stability by interacting with Rck. Decreased lifespan in Hpo-overexpressing Drosophila lines required expression of Me31b, but not DCP2, which was potentially mediated by recovering expression of lipid metabolic genes and formation of lipid droplets. Taken together, our findings suggest that Hpo/Mst1 plays a conserved role in longevity by regulating adipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism. ",Aging cell,

However, comprehensive nutritional-inflammatory indices for prognostic evaluation are rare in CKD. This study explored the association of the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and all-cause mortality in CKD patients. METHODS: A total of 1,982 CKD patients from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2011-2018) were included in the analysis. Analytical methods included linear regression, cox regression, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed, and further evaluation was conducted using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and C-index for all-cause mortality across different CKD stages. RESULTS: Among CKD patients, 1,103 patients (55.7%) were classified as stage I-II, and 879 patients (44.3%) as stage III-V. After adjusting covariates, ALI was found to be positively correlated with eGFR (Beta = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.07-0.15), and negatively related with all-cause mortality (HR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.63-0.83). Subgroup analysis showed that the positive correlation between ALI and eGFR was stronger in CKD stage III-V compared to stage I-II. However, ALI's protective effect on mortality was weaker in stage III-V. The C-index for ALI was 0.648 in stage I-II and 0.660 in stage III-V. CONCLUSION: ALI was significantly associated with eGFR and all-cause mortality in CKD patients. Nutritional and anti-inflammatory interventions in early-stage CKD may improve prognosis, and ALI may have great potential as a multifaceted biomarker to influence the prognosis of CKD, particularly in stages III-V.

We aimed to systematically update this topic due to cumulative data from pediatric/adult populations in wider geographical settings. METHODS: A search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases was performed. Primary outcomes were clinical response and histological remission (< 15 eos/HPF). Subgroup analyses included age group, PPI drug and dosage, study design, data origin, and risk of bias. Data were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: Seventy-three studies comprising 7304 patients were included. PPI therapy led to clinical response in 65% (95%CI, 57.2-72.4; I(2) 0), and histological remission in 45.4% (95%CI, 41.6- 49.3) of patients, without differences between children and adults (41.2% vs. 48%, p 0.17). Overall, 34.1% (95%CI, 27.9-40.5) achieved <5 eos/HPF. Pooled effectiveness was significantly superior (p<0.001) in Western Pacific areas, principally Japan (67.9%), compared to American and European (40.6% and 44.4%, respectively). Histological remission was significantly higher with double PPI doses compared to standard (51.7% vs. 28.3%, p 0.005). Response was significantly higher in studies with lower risk of bias. Maintenance half doses led to sustained histological remission in 68.2% (95%CI, 63.7%-72.6%; I(2)=0) of patients.

We aimed to identify potentially non-traditional CVD predictors for six facets of CVD (including coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation) in people with T2DM. METHODS: We analysed data on 600+ features from the UK Biobank, stratified by history of CVD and T2DM: 459,142 participants without diabetes or CVD, 14,610 with diabetes but without CVD, and 4432 with diabetes and CVD. A penalised generalized linear model with a binomial distribution was used to identify CVD-related features. Subsequently, a 20% hold-out set was used to replicate identified features and provide an importance based ranking. RESULTS: Here we show that non-traditional risk factors are of particular importance in people with diabetes. Classical CVD risk factors (e.g. family history, high blood pressure) rank highly in people without diabetes. For individuals with T2DM but no CVD, top predictors include cystatin C, self-reported health satisfaction, biochemical measures of ill health. In people with diabetes and CVD, key predictors are self-reported ill health and blood cell counts. Unique diabetes-related risk factors include dietary patterns, mental health and biochemistry measures (e.g. oestradiol, rheumatoid factor). Adding these features improves risk stratification; per 1000 people with diabetes, 133 CVD and 165 HF cases receive a higher risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies numerous replicated non-traditional CVD risk factors for people with T2DM, providing insight to improve guideline recommended risk prediction models which currently overlook these features.

METHODS: Tampons were collected prior to hysterectomy from 38 EC patients and 28 women with benign indications. Extracted tampon DNA underwent the following: 1) low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LC-WGS) to assess copy number, 2) pyrosequencing to measure percent promotor methylation of HOXA9, RASSF1, and CDH13 and 3) next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations in 19 genes associated with EC identified through The Cancer Genome Atlas. Sensitivity and specificity for each test and test combinations were calculated. RESULTS: Methylation analysis yielded the highest specificities but lowest sensitivities (37-40% sensitivity; 100% specificity for HOXA9, RASSF1 and HTR1B) while mutation analysis had improved sensitivity (50% sensitivity; 83% specificity). Only one ""false positive"" result for copy number variants was identified among women with benign surgical indications, which was based on detection of copy number changes, and associated with a leiomyosarcoma that was only recognized at hysterectomy. Considering any of the 3 biomarker classes as a positive, resulted in a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 86%. Mutation analysis did not add sensitivity to the combination of analysis of copy number and methylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a proof-of-principle for non-invasive yet precise detection of endometrial cancer. We propose that with improved biomarker testing, it may be possible to develop a clinically useful test for detecting EC. ",Gynecologic oncology,

Random-effects meta-analyses or descriptive syntheses were conducted depending on the number of studies. The evidence was interpreted and graded by an independent World Cancer Research Fund Expert Committee and Expert Panel. RESULTS: We included 31 RCTs (18 exercise, 14 diet) and 30 cohort studies (8 physical activity, 3 sedentary behaviour, 13 diet, 9 adiposity and body composition). Meta-analyses were possible for exercise RCTs that showed non-significant effects but indicative of improved HRQoL (overall four trials for global HRQoL, physical and emotional well-being) and fatigue (five trials). These studies were rated at a high risk of bias (RoB), and evidence was graded as 'very low certainty of an effect'. Descriptive synthesis of interventions to improve diet quality suggested small improvements in global HRQoL and physical well-being, but with a high RoB rating leading to a 'low certainty' grading. Evidence from RCTs on probiotics and supplements and evidence from observational studies on sedentary behaviour, and various dietary and body composition factors was generally inconsistent and too scarce to draw conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise and diet quality interventions might improve HRQoL and fatigue outcomes in colorectal cancer survivors. The evidence overall was limited and should be strengthened by larger, well-designed RCTs across the cancer continuum. ",ESMO open,

Dysregulation of ferroptosis is closely associated with HCC. However, the effect of the epigenetic mRNA m5C modification on ferroptosis in HCC remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, ferroptosis was evaluated by detecting lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), ferrous ion and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in xenograft mouse model, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated HCC model and so forth. The regulatory mechanisms of YBX1 in mRNA translation were elucidated using RNA sequencing, ribosome sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-sequencing, bisulphite sequencing and immunoprecipitation (IP)-mass spectrometry assays. Dual-luciferase reporter, RIP-qPCR, Co-IP, RNA pulldown and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were performed to validate the mechanism of YBX1 in regulating mRNA translation by m5C modification. RESULTS: Here, we found that YBX1 promoted the translation of Ring Finger Protein 115 (RNF115) mRNA through m5C modification, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting HCC development. Moreover, RNF115 was identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), promoting Lys27 (K27) ubiquitination and inhibiting its autophagic degradation to counteract ferroptosis. In addition, YBX1 bound to the m5C modification sites of RNF115 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and interacted with Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4A1 (EIF4A1) to bridge the 5'-UTR regions, promoting mRNA circularisation and translation, while NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSUN2) was identified as responsible for m5C modification of RNF115 mRNA in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: The current work revealed that YBX1 promoted RNF115 mRNA translation in an m5C-dependent manner, thereby regulating DHODH ubiquitination and expression to suppress ferroptosis. This research sheds light on the mechanism of YBX1 in m5C-modified mRNAs translation and ferroptosis, highlighting its promise as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapy in HCC. KEY POINTS: YBX1 inhibits ferroptosis in HCC by regulating the RNF115-DHODH axis. RNF115, an E3 ligase, mediates K27 ubiquitination and autophagic degradation of DHODH. YBX1 binds to the m5C sites of RNF115 mRNA 3'-UTR and interacts with EIF4A1 to bridge the 5'-UTR, promoting mRNA circularisation and translation.

Nonetheless, immune suppression triggered by ADV and targeted enhancements based on this limitation have been relatively unexplored. METHODS: Flow cytometry was employed to assess immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment following ADV therapy. Targeted novel recombinant oncolytic viruses, ADV(NE) and ADV(PPE), were designed, and their antitumor efficacy, safety, and ability to reshape immune infiltration were evaluated in both subcutaneous tumor models in mice and in vitro experiments. Immune cell depletion assays confirmed the critical role of macrophages. The impact of HMGB1 on macrophage polarization was investigated using shRNA, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the importance of TLR4 and its downstream pathways was validated through immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, homozygous knockout mice, and TLR4 inhibitors. RESULTS: We demonstrated that ADV limits the infiltration of effector memory/effector CD8 + T cells (T(EM)/T(E)) within the tumor microenvironment. To address this, we leveraged the strong capacity of NE or PPE to recruit T(EM)/T(E) by constructing novel recombinant oncolytic adenoviruses, ADV(NE) or ADV(PPE), armed with NE or PPE. These recombinant viruses induce pyroptosis in colorectal cancer cells accompanied by the release of HMGB1. HMGB1 binds to TLR4 on the surface of macrophages, activating the MyD88-NFκB-NLRP3 (ASC) pathway and promoting M1 polarization of TAMs, thereby increasing T(EM)/T(E) cell infiltration and enhancing antitumor efficacy.

In the present study, we analyzed two postmortem datasets, which included 173 and 129 cases positive for Lewy pathology. We observed a clear distinction between brain-first and body-first subtypes in early prediagnostic cases with mild Lewy pathology. Brain-first cases displayed minimal peripheral organ pathology in prediagnostic phases, contrasting with marked autonomic involvement in prediagnostic body-first cases. Utilizing the SuStaIn machine learning algorithm, we identified two distinct body-first subtypes, one with vagal predominance and another with sympathetic predominance, in equal proportions. Our study supports the existence of three prediagnostic LBD subtypes and highlights the sympathetic nervous system alongside the parasympathetic system in LBD onset and progression.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose cholecalciferol as monotherapy in reducing disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) typical for MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The D-Lay MS trial was a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 MS centers in France. Patients were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2020 (final follow-up on January 18, 2023). Untreated patients with CIS aged 18 to 55 years with CIS duration less than 90 days, serum vitamin D concentration less than 100 nmol/L, and diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meeting 2010 criteria for dissemination in space or 2 or more lesions and presence of oligoclonal bands were recruited. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU (n = 163) or placebo (n = 153) every 2 weeks for 24 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was disease activity, defined as occurrence of a relapse and/or MRI activity (new and/or contrast-enhancing lesions) over 24 months of follow-up, also analyzed as separate secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 316 participants enrolled and randomized (median [IQR] age, 34 [28-42] years; 70% women), the primary analysis included 303 patients (95.9%) who took at least 1 dose of the study drug and 288 (91.1%) ultimately completed the 24-month trial. Disease activity was observed in 94 patients (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 patients (74.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50-0.87]; P = .004), and median time to disease activity was longer in the vitamin D group (432 vs 224 days; log-rank P = .003). All 3 secondary MRI outcomes reported significant differences favoring the vitamin D group vs the placebo group: MRI activity (89 patients [57.1%] vs 96 patients [65.3%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53-0.95]; P = .02), new lesions (72 patients [46.2%] vs 87 patients [59.2%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.44-0.84]; P = .003), and contrast-enhancing lesions (29 patients [18.6%] vs 50 patients [34.0%]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30-0.75]; P = .001). All 10 secondary clinical outcomes showed no significant difference, including relapse, which occurred in 28 patients (17.9%) in the vitamin D group vs 32 (21.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.42-1.16]; P = .16). Results were similar in a subset of 247 patients meeting updated 2017 diagnostic criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at treatment initiation. Severe adverse events occurred in 17 patients in the vitamin D group and 13 in the placebo group, none of which were related to cholecalciferol. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU every 2 weeks significantly reduced disease activity in CIS and early relapsing-remitting MS. These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as add-on therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01817166. ",JAMA,

This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model using a novel voxel-level radiomics approach to predict pCR based on preoperative CT images. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study, 741 patients with ESCC who underwent nICT followed by radical esophagectomy were enrolled from three institutions. Patients from one center were divided into a training set (469 patients) and an internal validation set (118 patients) while the data from the other two centers was used as external validation sets (120 and 34 patients, respectively). The deep learning model, Vision-Mamba, integrated voxel-level radiomics feature maps and CT images for pCR prediction. Additionally, other commonly used deep learning models, including 3D-ResNet and Vision Transformer, as well as traditional radiomics methods, were developed for comparison. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic stratification capabilities. The SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was employed to interpret the model's predictions. RESULTS: The Vision-Mamba model demonstrated robust predictive performance in the training set (accuracy: 0.89, AUC: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.82, specificity: 0.92) and validation sets (accuracy: 0.83-0.91, AUC: 0.83-0.92, sensitivity: 0.73-0.94, specificity: 0.84-1.0). The model outperformed other deep learning models and traditional radiomics methods. The model's ability to stratify patients into high and low-risk groups was validated, showing superior prognostic stratification compared with traditional methods. SHAP provided quantitative and visual model interpretation.

In phase 1 of the MonumenTAL-1 study, initial results of subcutaneous talquetamab 0·4 mg/kg once a week and 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks showed preliminary clinical activity. We describe safety and activity results in patients treated with talquetamab, including patients who had received previous T-cell redirection therapy (TCR). This post-hoc analysis was done with more mature median follow-up to evaluate duration of response in patients treated with talquetamab 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. METHODS: MonumenTAL-1 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 1-2 study of talquetamab, phase 1 of which has previously been published. The 0·4 mg/kg once a week and 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks recommended subcutaneous doses identified in phase 1 were evaluated in phase 2 in patients who were 18 years of age or older, had at least three previous lines of therapy, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and were naive or exposed to previous TCR. The primary endpoint was overall response rate assessed by independent review committee in all patients who received at least one dose of talquetamab. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of talquetamab. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399799 (phase 1) and NCT04634552 (phase 2). FINDINGS: Between Jan 3, 2018, and Feb 20, 2023, 735 patients were screened across all phase 1-2 cohorts. Of these, 537 patients screened for inclusion were treated across phase 1 and 2 cohorts, of whom 1983 (27%) patients were excluded from the study, most commonly due to not meeting eligibility criteria or not having measurable disease. As of Oct 11, 2023, 375 patients had received recommended talquetamab doses across three groups: 143 (0·4 mg/kg once a week group) and 154 (0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group) TCR-naive patients and 78 with previous TCR who received either recommended dose (previous TCR group). 217 (58%) of 375 patients were male and 158 (42%) were female. 325 (87%) of 375 patients were White and 32 (9%) patients were Black. Median follow-up was 25·6 months (IQR 8·5-25·9) in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, 19·4 months (9·2-20·7) in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and 16·8 months (7·6-18·7) in the previous TCR group. Overall response rate was 74% (106 of 143 patients, 95% CI 66-81) in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, 69% (107 of 154 patients, 62-77) in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and 67% (52 of 78 patients, 55-77) in the previous TCR group. Most common adverse events in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week, 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and previous TCR groups were cytokine release syndrome (113 [79%] of 143 patients, 115 [75%] of 154 patients, and 57 [73%] of 78 patients), taste changes (103 [72%], 110 [71%], and 59 [76%]), and infections (85 [59%], 105 [68%], and 59 [76%]). Most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (44 [31%], 33 [21%], and 37 [47%]), anaemia (45 [31%], 40 [26%], and 21 [27%]), and lymphopenia (37 [26%], 40 [26%], and 13 [17%]). Fatal adverse events occurred in five patients in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, seven patients in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and no patients in the previous TCR group; none were related to treatment. INTERPRETATION: Talquetamab continued to demonstrate high overall response rates in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with longer follow-up in this post-hoc analysis.

Whereas IF involves cyclic metabolic switching (CMS) between ketogenic and non-ketogenic states, KDs and CR may not. In this Perspective, I postulate that the beneficial effects of IF result from alternating between activation of adaptive cellular stress response pathways during the fasting period, followed by cell growth and plasticity pathways during the feeding period. Thereby, I establish the cyclic metabolic switching (CMS) theory of IF. The health benefits of IF may go beyond those seen with continuous CR or KDs without CMS owing to the unique interplay between the signalling functions of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate, mitochondrial adaptations, reciprocal activation of autophagy and mTOR pathways, endocrine and paracrine signalling, gut microbiota, and circadian biology. The CMS theory may have important implications for future basic research, clinical trials, development of pharmacological interventions, and healthy lifestyle practices. ",Nature metabolism,

Developmental stage-specific RORα-deficient mice showed a decrease in adult liver and BM IL-7R+ ILC1s and an increase in BM NK cells, whereas fetal liver ILC1s and adult liver IL-7R- ILC1s remained unchanged.

While emerging AD therapeutics can slow cognitive decline, they may worsen dementia in certain groups of individuals. Therefore, alternative treatments are much needed. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, have the potential to be novel therapeutic targets as they regulate many facets of AD, including lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance, and neuroinflammation. To carry out such functions, microglia undergo phenotypic changes, which are linked to shifts in metabolism and substrate utilization. While homeostatic microglia are driven by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, in aging and AD, microglia shift further towards glycolysis. Interestingly, this ""metabolic reprogramming"" may be linked to an increase in fructose metabolism. In the brain, microglia predominantly express the fructose transporter SLC2A5 (GLUT5), and enzymes involved in fructolysis and endogenous fructose production, with their expression being upregulated in aging and disease. Here, we review evidence for fructose uptake, breakdown, and production in microglia. We also evaluate emerging literature targeting fructose metabolism in the brain and periphery to assess its ability to modulate microglial function in AD. The ability of microglia to transport and utilize fructose, coupled with the well-established role of fructose in metabolic dysfunction, supports the notion that microglial fructose metabolism may be a novel potential therapeutic target for AD.

The Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota (DI-GM) integrates the potential relationship between diet and gut microbiota diversity. This study aims to investigate the association between DI-GM and the risk of NAFLD and liver fibrosis, providing theoretical support for dietary intervention strategies. METHODS: This study utilized data from NHANES 2017-2020, including 6,181 eligible adult participants. The relationship between DI-GM and the risk of NAFLD and liver fibrosis was assessed using DI-GM quartiles, multivariate logistic regression, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed to explore the predictive role of DI-GM in different populations. All analyses were weighted to ensure the representativeness of the results. RESULTS: DI-GM was negatively associated with the risks of NAFLD and liver fibrosis. As DI-GM scores increased, the risk of NAFLD and liver fibrosis significantly decreased (52.81%, 43.16%, 40.40%, and 31.98%, p < 0.05; 17.52%, 9.04%, 7.21%, and 6.78%, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that, in the unadjusted model (Model 1), for each unit increase in DI-GM, the risk of NAFLD decreased by 6.9% (OR = 0.931, 95% CI: 0.886-0.979, p < 0.001), while the risk of liver fibrosis decreased by 15.6% (OR = 0.844, 95% CI: 0.757-0.941, p < 0.05).

Nevertheless, its precise role and the underlying mechanisms in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) are not fully understood. This study examined whether Metrnl can mitigate MI/RI through the AMPK-mediated polarization of M2 macrophages. METHODS: In vivo, adeno-associated virus 9 containing the F4/80 promoter (AAV9-F4/80) was utilized to overexpress Metrnl in mouse cardiac macrophages before MI/RI surgery. In vitro, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with recombinant protein Metrnl, and the human cardiomyocyte cell line AC16 was subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) after co-culture with the supernatant of these macrophages. Cardiac function was assessed via echocardiography, H&E staining, and Evans blue-TTC staining. Inflammatory infiltration was evaluated by RT-qPCR and ELISA, apoptosis by Western blotting and TUNEL staining, and macrophage polarization by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In vivo, Metrnl overexpression in cardiac macrophages significantly attenuated MI/RI, as evidenced by reduced myocardial infarct size, enhancement of cardiac function, diminished inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, Metrnl overexpression promoted M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. In vitro, BMDMs treated with Metrnl shifted towards M2 polarization, characterized by decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, MCP-1, TNF-α) and increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Additionally, supernatant from Metrnl-treated macrophages protected AC16 cells from apoptosis under H/R conditions, as evidenced by decreased BAX expression and increased BCL-2 expression. However, these effects of Metrnl were inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. CONCLUSIONS: Metrnl alleviates MI/RI by activating AMPK-mediated M2 macrophage polarization to attenuate inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of Metrnl in MI/RI, and identifies it as a promising target for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. ","Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",

OBJECTIVES: This study explored the role of trained immunity in enhancing resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection in mice and chickens. METHODS: We investigated the effects of probiotics and inactivated pathogenic bacterial strains on host immunity in Toll-like receptor 2-deficient mice (TLR2(-)/(-)) to assess whether these effects were related to bacterial outer membrane components such as peptidoglycan (PNG), lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Bacterial genomes were evaluated for their ability to enhance the host immune system. Macrophage-depletion models were used to identify the key immune cells involved in trained immunity, with a focus on the cGAS-STING pathway. RESULTS: Probiotics and inactivated pathogenic strains enhanced host immunity and protected against S. Typhimurium infection. As demonstrated in the TLR2-deficient mice, the effects were not dependent on bacterial outer membrane components. Instead, bacterial genomes played a significant role in activating trained immunity. Macrophages were identified as the primary cells that mediated the response with the cGAS-STING pathway playing a crucial role. The results observed using the mouse models led to investigating the potential application of trained immunity in poultry. CONCLUSION: Trained immunity activated by probiotics and inactivated bacterial pathogens enhanced resistance against S. Typhimurium infection via macrophage activation and involved the cGAS-STING pathway. These findings highlight the potential of trained immunity as an alternative strategy for disease prevention in both livestock and poultry. ",Journal of advanced research,

METHODS: This study conducted different analyses, including the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), weighted correlation networks (WGCNA), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi), and multiCox analysis, utilizing data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Subsequently, the machine learning algorithms including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest (RF), combined with multiCox analysis were exploited to identify hub genes. These findings were then validated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier analysis, and were experimentally confirmed in GC samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Integrated analysis of TCGA and GEO databases, coupled with LASSO regression and RF algorithms, allowed us to identify 18 hub genes encoding differentially expressed secreted proteins in GC. The results of RT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis revealed four promising biomarkers with optimal diagnostic and prognostic potential. ROC analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves highlighted CHI3L1, FCGBP, VSIG2, and TFF2 as promising biomarkers for GC, offering superior modeling accuracy. These findings were further confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA, affirming the clinical utility of these four biomarkers. Additionally, CIBERSORT analysis indicated a potential correlation between the four biomarkers and the infiltration of B memory cells and Treg cells. CONCLUSION: This study unveiled four promising biomarkers present in the serum of patients with GC, which could serve as powerful indicators of GC and provide valuable insights for further research into GC pathogenesis.

The inability to target antigen-low cells is an intrinsic vulnerability of second-generation CAR T cells and underlies most relapses following CD22BBz CAR T cell therapy. Here, we interrogate CD22BBz CAR signaling in response to low antigen and find inefficient phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) limiting downstream signaling. To overcome this, we designed the adjunctive LAT-activating CAR T cell (ALA-CART) platform, pairing a second-generation CAR with a LAT-CAR incorporating the intracellular domain of LAT. ALA-CART cells demonstrate reduced differentiation during manufacturing and increased LAT phosphorylation, MAPK signaling, and AP-1 activity. ALA-CART cells show improved cytotoxicity, proliferation, persistence, and efficacy against antigen-low leukemias that were refractory to clinically active CD22BBz CAR T cells. Restoration of LAT signaling through the ALA-CART platform represents a promising strategy for overcoming multiple mechanisms of CAR T cell failure. ",Cancer cell,

OBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate associations of biomarker-assessed EI with both biomarker-assessed and self-reported macronutrient component densities in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) sub-cohort of postmenopausal U.S. females. Secondarily, we examine energy underreporting using food records, recalls and frequencies, for association with macronutrient densities. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a previously proposed EI biomarker equation based on doubly-labeled water (DLW) and updated biomarker equations for several macronutrient component densities, to estimate EI and macronutrient component densities in a WHI nutritional biomarkers sub-cohort (n=436; 2007-2009). We used linear regression of EI biomarker values on biomarker and self-reported macronutrient component densities, and of log-EI underreporting values on biomarker densities, to examine targeted associations. RESULTS: Using biomarker assessments, the geometric mean (95% CI) for EI corresponding to a 20% increment in carbohydrate density was 2.0% (0.1%, 3.9%) higher, and for a 20% protein density increment was 2.1% (0.5%, 3.7%) lower. The former was attributable to added sugars. Similarly, EI values for 20% increments in polyunsaturated (PUFA), and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids densities were respectively 1.4% (0.3%, 2.6%) higher, and 1.5% (0.1%, 2.9%) lower. Pertinent associations were either not detected or were substantially attenuated if instead self-reported macronutrient densities were used. Also, EI underreporting was strongly related to self-reported macronutrient densities using food records, recalls, or frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Among U.S. postmenopausal females lower EI was associated with diets relatively high in protein or MUFA, and higher EI was associated with diets relatively high in PUFA or added sugars. These associations are of public health importance, but are mostly missed using self-reported dietary density assessments.

This process-termed pupariation-is triggered by a surge in the hormone ecdysone. Substrate attachment is achieved by a pupariation subprogram called glue expulsion and spreading behavior (GSB). An epidermis-to-CNS Dilp8-Lgr3 relaxin signaling event that occurs downstream of ecdysone is critical for unlocking progression of the pupariation motor program toward GSB, but the factors and circuits acting downstream of Lgr3 signaling remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific RNA interference and behavioral monitoring, we identify Myoinhibiting peptide (Mip) as a neuromodulator of multiple GSB action components, such as tetanic contraction, peristaltic contraction alternation, and head-waving. Mip is required in a pair of brain descending neurons, which act temporally downstream of Dilp8-Lgr3 signaling. Mip modulates GSB via ventral nerve cord neurons expressing its conserved receptor, sex peptide receptor (SPR). Silencing of Mip descending neurons by hyperpolarization completely abrogates GSB, while their optogenetic activation at a restricted competence time window triggers GSB-like behavior. Hence, Mip descending neurons have at least two functions: to act as GSB command neurons and to secrete Mip to modulate GSB action components. Our results provide insight into conserved aspects of Mip-SPR signaling in animals, reveal the complexity of GSB control, and contribute to the understanding of how multistep innate behaviors are coordinated in time and with other developmental processes through command neurons and neuropeptidergic signaling.

Here we measured H5N1 antibody responses in sera from 157 individuals born between 1927 and 2016. We show that antibody titers to historical and recent H5N1 strains are highest in older individuals and correlate more strongly with birth year than with age, consistent with immune imprinting. Young children, who were likely not yet exposed to seasonal influenza viruses, had low levels of H5-specific antibodies. We also measured H5N1 antibody responses in sera from 100 individuals before and after receiving an A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 vaccine. We found that both younger and older humans produced H5-reactive antibodies to the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine strain and to a contemporary clade 2.3.4.4b strain, with higher seroconversion rates in young children who had lower levels of antibodies before vaccination.

The causes of cognitive decline in these patients are likely to be multifactorial, including vascular disease, uraemic toxins, blood-brain barrier leakage, and metabolic and endocrine changes. Gut dysbiosis is common in patients with CKD and contributes to the increase in uraemic toxins. However, the gut microbiome modulates local and systemic levels of several metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids or derivatives of tryptophan metabolism, neurotransmitters, endocannabinoid-like mediators, bile acids, hormones such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) or cholecystokinin (CCK). These factors can affect gut function, immunity, autonomic nervous system activity and various aspects of brain function. Key areas include blood-brain barrier integrity, nerve myelination and survival/proliferation, appetite, metabolism and thermoregulation, mood, anxiety and depression, stress and local inflammation. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and the production of biologically active metabolites in patients with CKD are well documented and are favoured by low-fiber diets, elevated urea levels, sedentary lifestyles, slow stool transit times and polypharmacy. In turn, dysbiosis can modulate brain function and cognitive processes, as discussed in this review.

Most frequently, these hallmark lesions are accompanied by other co-pathologies in the brain that may contribute to cognitive impairment, such as vascular lesions, intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated transactive-response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and/or α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. To estimate the extent of these AD and co-pathologies in patients, several biomarkers have been developed. Specific tracers target and visualize Aβ plaques, p-τ and αSyn pathology or inflammation by positron emission tomography. In addition to these imaging biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-based biomarker assays reflecting AD-specific or non-specific processes are either already in clinical use or in development. In this review, we will introduce the pathological lesions of the AD brain, the related biomarkers, and discuss to what extent the respective biomarkers estimate the pathology determined at post-mortem histopathological analysis. It became evident that initial stages of Aβ plaque and p-τ pathology are not detected with the currently available biomarkers. Interestingly, p-τ pathology precedes Aβ deposition, especially in the beginning of the disease when biomarkers are unable to detect it. Later, Aβ takes the lead and accelerates p-τ pathology, fitting well with the known evolution of biomarker measures over time. Some co-pathologies still lack clinically established biomarkers today, such as TDP-43 pathology or cortical microinfarcts. In summary, specific biomarkers for AD-related pathologies allow accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on pathobiological parameters. Although current biomarkers are excellent measures for the respective pathologies, they fail to detect initial stages of the disease for which post-mortem analysis of the brain is still required. Accordingly, neuropathological studies remain essential to understand disease development especially in early stages. Moreover, there is an urgent need for biomarkers reflecting co-pathologies, such as limbic predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy-related pathology, which is known to modify the disease by interacting with p-τ. Novel biomarker approaches such as extracellular vesicle-based assays and cryptic RNA/peptides may help to better detect these co-pathologies in the future. ",Molecular neurodegeneration,

Although the governing role of energy metabolism in shaping the inflammatory phenotype and function of immune cells has been increasingly recognized, the specific alterations in microglial bioenergetics post-TBI remain poorly understood. Itaconate, a metabolite produced by the enzyme aconitate decarboxylase 1 [IRG1; encoded by immune responsive gene 1 (Irg1)], is a pivotal metabolic regulator in immune cells, particularly in macrophages. Because microglia are macrophages of the brain parenchyma, the IRG1/itaconate pathway likely modulates microglial inflammatory responses. In this study, we explored the role of the IRG1/itaconate pathway in regulating microglial bioenergetics and inflammatory activation post-TBI using a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. We isolated microglia before and 4 and 12 hours after TBI and observed a swift but transient increase in glycolysis coupled with a prolonged disruption of mitochondrial metabolism after injury. Despite an up-regulation of Irg1 expression, itaconate in microglia declined after TBI. Microglia-specific Irg1 gene knockout (Irg1-Mi-KO) exacerbated metabolic changes, intensified proinflammatory activation and neurodegeneration, and worsened certain long-term neurological deficits. Supplementation with 4-octyl itaconate (OI) reinstated the use and oxidative metabolism of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid, thereby enhancing microglial bioenergetics post-TBI. OI supplementation also attenuated proinflammatory activation and neurodegeneration and improved long-term neurological outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To identify circulating proteins associated with risk for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as cognitive task performance (CTP). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a 2-sample MR design, significant proteomic quantitative trait loci were used as candidate instruments, obtained from 2 large-scale plasma proteomics datasets: the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (2923 proteins per 34 557 UK individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4719 proteins per 35 559 Icelandic individuals). Data analysis was performed from November 2023 to November 2024. EXPOSURE: Genetic influence on circulating levels of proteins in plasma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures were summary statistics drawn from recent large-scale genome-wide association studies for SCZ (67 323 cases and 93 456 controls), BD (40 463 cases and 313 436 controls), MDD (166 773 cases and 507 679 controls), and CTP (215 333 individuals). MR was carried out for each phenotype, and proteins that showed statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected P < .05) associations from MR analysis were used for pathway, protein-protein interaction, drug target enrichment, and potential druggability analysis for each outcome phenotype separately. RESULTS: MR analysis revealed 113 Bonferroni-corrected associations (46 novel) involving 91 proteins across the 4 outcome phenotypes. Immune-related proteins, such as interleukins and complement factors, showed pleiotropic effects across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis provided support for repurposing of anti-inflammatory agents for SCZ, amantadine for BD, retinoic acid for MDD, and duloxetine for CTP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Identifying potentially causal effects of circulating proteins on neuropsychiatric phenotypes suggests potential biomarkers and offers insights for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

The purpose of the guidelines is to assist healthcare providers in making appropriate decisions in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock, leading to improved patient outcomes. We aimed to create guidelines that are easy to understand and use for physicians who recognize sepsis and provide initial management, specialized physicians who take over the treatment, and multidisciplinary healthcare providers, including nurses, physical therapists, clinical engineers, and pharmacists. The J-SSCG 2024 covers the following nine areas: diagnosis of sepsis and source control, antimicrobial therapy, initial resuscitation, blood purification, disseminated intravascular coagulation, adjunctive therapy, post-intensive care syndrome, patient and family care, and pediatrics. In these areas, we extracted 78 important clinical issues. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method was adopted for making recommendations, and the modified Delphi method was used to determine recommendations by voting from all committee members. As a result, 42 GRADE-based recommendations, 7 good practice statements, and 22 information-to-background questions were created as responses to clinical questions.

ATF4 was critical for driving an effector T(reg) transcriptional program, and ATF4-expressing T(regs) promoted the development of obesity-induced liver fibrosis by enhancing transforming growth factor-β activation via integrin αvβ8. T(reg)-specific deletion of Atf4 resulted in reduced liver T(regs) and attenuation of obesity-induced liver abnormalities. Furthermore, ATF4 was required to promote the differentiation of nonlymphoid tissue T(reg) precursors under steady state.

METHODS: A total of 30 CAD patients and 30 healthy individuals, as well as patients with different cardiovascular diseases, were included in this study. Blood was drawn from each participant to prepare serum samples, and the expression of lncRNA H19 was detected using qRT-PCR. The ROC curve analysis was used to analyze the diagnostic value of H19 for CAD. The effects of patients' basic information and lifestyle on H19 expression were analyzed. The plasma level of TGF-β1 was measured by ELISA. The H19 overexpression in the human primary coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) line was constructed, and the effects of H19 overexpression on the TGF-β1 expression were analyzed using Western blot. The results of H19 expression were specifically upregulated in patients with CAD but not in healthy individuals and patients with other types of cardiovascular diseases. The ROC curve analysis showed that the H19 expression level could be used to predict CAD accurately. Gender, age, and patients' lifestyle had no significant effects on H19 expression, but H19 expression was higher in patients with a longer course of disease in comparison with the controls. H19 expression was positively correlated with the serum level of TGF-β1, and H19 overexpression significantly increased TGF-β1 protein level in HCAEC. CONCLUSION: H19 overexpression participates in the pathogenesis of CAD by increasing the expression level of TGF-β1, and H19 expression level may serve as a diagnostic marker for CAD.

One of the ""iron laws"" of EAS is that an electron-rich aromatic ring will react more rapidly than an electron-poor ring with suitable electrophiles. In this report, we present unique examples of electron-deficient arenes instead undergoing preferential substitution in intramolecular competition with more electron-rich rings. These results were made possible by exploiting the heretofore unknown propensity of a hydrogen-bonding OH-arene interaction to switch to the alternative HO-arene interaction in order to provide activation. In an extreme case, this through-space HO-arene activation is demonstrated to overcome the deactivating effect of a trifluoromethyl substituent, making an otherwise highly electron-deficient ring the site of exclusive reactivity in competition experiments. Additionally, the HO-arene activation promotes tetrabromination of an increasingly more electron-deficient arene before the unactivated ""control"" ring undergoes monobromination. It is our hope that these results will shed light on biological interactions as well as provide new strategies for the electrophilic substitution of aromatic rings.

Although having no general homology with published sequences, the positions of the cysteine residues in the two repeats show a conserved pattern, similar to that of the cellulose-binding domain of fungal glycanases. CBEL did not possess hydrolytic activity on a variety of glycans, but bound to fibrous cellulose and plant cell walls. In addition, it exerted a lectin-like hemagglutinating activity. Infiltration of tobacco leaves (cultivar 46-8) with this molecule elicited necrosis and defense gene expression at 150 nM.

PINK1 knockout aggravated cartilage damage due to impaired mitophagy. SIRT3 directly deacetylated PINK1 to promote mitophagy and cartilage anabolism. Specifically, PINK1 phosphorylated PKM2 at the Ser127 site, preserving its active tetrameric form. This inhibited nuclear translocation and the interaction with β-catenin, resulting in a metabolic shift and increased energy production.

However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of m(6)A in IAV RNA. In the present study, we identified the m(6)A methylation of the viral RNA of different IAV subtypes and confirmed that m(6)A modification promotes the polymerase activity and replication of IAV. By mutating m(6)A motifs on the multiple viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV, we revealed that m(6)A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the expression of viral genes and the replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, m(6)A deficiency in vRNA reduced the pathogenicity of IAV in a mouse model. Mechanistically, m(6)A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex by impairing the interaction between vRNA and vRNP proteins in an m(6)A methyltransferase-dependent manner, but not the m(6)A reader proteins.

Thirty-eight indicators including biological factors, behavioral factors and health status were analyzed in this study. The study cohort was randomly divided into the training set (70%) and the validation set (30%). Variables were screened using LASSO regression analysis, the best predictive model based on 10-fold cross-validation, logistic regression model was applied to explore the correlates of fall risk in the older individuals, a nomogram was constructed to develop the predictive model, calibration curves were applied to assess the accuracy of the nomogram model, and predictive performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis. RESULT: A total of 4,913 cases from the 2015 CHARLS database for people aged 60 years and older were ultimately included, and a total of 1,082 (22.02%) of the older individuals had experienced a fall within two years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Sleeping time, Hearing, Grip strength, ADL score, Cognition, Depression, Health, KD, and Pain DRUG were predictors of fall risk in the older individuals. These factors were used to construct nomogram models that showed good agreement and accuracy. The AUC value for the predictive model was 0.644 (95% CI = 0.621-0.666), with a specificity of 0.695 and a sensitivity of 0.522.

RGMb is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family. RGMb can be expressed on the cell surface but a large portion of RGMb is localized intracellularly. Among various immune cell types, macrophages express the highest levels of RGMb, but the biological functions of RGMb in macrophages remain largely unknown. We find that RGMb promoted macrophage migration in vitro and that in vivo, RGMb enhanced infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys and aggravated kidney inflammation and injury in mice. Mechanistically, RGMb bound to TAB1 inside the cell and facilitated the interaction between TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAB1, thereby promoting TRAF6-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of TAK1, followed by increased αTAT1 phosphorylation and α-tubulin acetylation. The resulting changes in the cytoskeleton promoted macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Rgmb in macrophages markedly reduced TAK1 phosphorylation, αTAT1 phosphorylation, and α-tubulin acetylation and attenuated macrophage infiltration, renal inflammation, tubular injury, and interstitial fibrosis during kidney injury. Our results suggest that macrophage RGMb promotes kidney disease by increasing macrophage infiltration via the TRAF6-TAB1-TAK1/αTAT1/α-tubulin cascade.

METHODS: This community-based prospective cohort study evaluated sarcopenia, obesity, and baseline clinical characteristics in 4321 non-diabetic older adults between 2007 and 2011. Sarcopenia was identified using skeletal muscle mass/body weight (SMM/BW), appendicular lean mass (ALM)/BW, and handgrip strength (HGS), and obesity was identified by fat mass (FM)/BW. The association of sarcopenia and obesity with AF risk was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. Interaction analysis, a restricted cubic splines model, mediation analysis, and a Fine-Gray competing-risk model were also used. RESULTS: Over an average of 10.9 years of follow-up, 546 (11.98 per 1000 person-years) participants developed AF. Low SMM/BW, low ALM/BW, low HGS, high FM/BW, sarcopenia and obesity, were significantly associated with an increased AF risk. There was a significant synergistic relationship between sarcopenia and obesity in the increased AF risk [hazard ratio (HR): 2.029, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.639-2.512]. Compared with participants without sarcopenia and obesity, AF risk was the highest in those with SO (HR: 2.669, 95 % CI: 2.110-3.377], followed by sarcopenia alone (HR: 1.980, 95%CI: 1.453-2.699) and obesity (HR: 1.839, 95%CI: 1.475-2.292). Mediation analysis found that estimated glucose disposal rate (a surrogate marker of IR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and galectin-3 were mediating factors in the increased AF risk caused by SO, accounting for 34.87 %, 27.56 %, and 21.05 % of the total effect, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SO significantly increased AF risk in these non-diabetic older individuals. Sarcopenia and obesity not only acted alone but also exhibit had a synergistic relationship to increase AF risk. IR and inflammation mediated the increased AF risk associated with SO.

Vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins have been demonstrated to regulate vascular calcification. ECM protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS1/TSP-1) plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular diseases. However, whether THBS1 is involved in vascular calcification in CKD patients remains unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database GSE146638 showed that THBS1 was upregulated in the aortas of CKD rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) revealed that serum THBS1 levels were increased in CKD patients with thoracic calcification. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that THBS1 expression was increased in calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and arteries. THBS1 knockdown exacerbated rat VSMC calcification induced by high phosphorus and calcium, as shown by Alizarin red staining and calcium content assays. Conversely, THBS1 overexpression attenuated VSMC calcification and abdominal aortic calcification in rats with CKD. Moreover, addition of recombinant THBS1 protein inhibited calcification of VSMC(S) and human arterial rings. Smooth muscle cell-specific knockout of THBS1 mice treated with vitamin D3 displayed aggravated aortic calcification. Mechanistically, the protein-protein interaction database STRING (http://string-db.org/) analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed THBS1 bound to integrin β3. Reduction of integrin β3 levels abrogated the protective effect of THBS1 on vascular calcification. RNA-seq analysis revealed that THBS1 overexpression modulated the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Of note, the inhibitory effect of THBS1 overexpression on the NF-κB signal was abolished by knockdown of integrin β3. In conclusion, THBS1 interacts with integrin β3 to inhibit vascular calcification through suppression of NF-κB signal, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for vascular calcification in CKD. © 2025 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

In this study, we identify gut microbiota-derived succinate as a driver of inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) by activating succinate-responsive, colitogenic helper T (Th) cells that secrete interleukin (IL)-9. We demonstrate that colitis is associated with an increase in succinate-producing gut bacteria and decrease in succinate-metabolizing gut bacteria. Similarly, UC patients exhibit elevated levels of succinate-producing gut bacteria and luminal succinate. Intestinal colonization by succinate-producing gut bacteria or increased succinate availability, exacerbates colonic inflammation by activating colitogenic Th9 cells. In contrast, intestinal colonization by succinate-metabolizing gut bacteria, blocking succinate receptor signaling with an antagonist, or neutralizing IL-9 with an anti-IL-9 antibody alleviates inflammation by reducing colitogenic Th9 cells. Our findings underscore the role of gut microbiota-derived succinate in driving colitogenic Th9 cells and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating IBD.

Previous research has demonstrated that inflammatory activity from autoimmune diseases is involved in neurological diseases. However, some studies question the association between inflammatory activities and neurodevelopmental disorders. Herein, we attempt to clarify this relationship using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: We used systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) to represent autoimmune diseases. First, we conducted MR analysis to examine associated SNPs between autoimmune and neurodevelopmental disorders. Second, we performed bidirectional MR analysis to identify 429 types of signalling peptides and proteins or relevant receptors with causality reported diseases. Finally, we compared the genes with the gene loci identified in the available TWAS-hub site. RESULTS: The MR results of autoimmune diseases on neurodevelopmental disorders did not present any significant association in all models. However, we identified 20-45 factors in ADHD, ASD, and schizophrenia, including semaphorin 3, IL-27 receptor subunit alpha, and fibroblast growth factor 16, which were considered clinically significant pro-inflammatory mediators. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed unequal integrities among the three neurodevelopmental diseases, and we failed to identify a shared pathway linking autoimmune diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. TWAS analysis indicated that CHRNA5 potentially mediates inflammatory activities in schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: According to our data, we failed to identify an association between autoimmune diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders.

We aimed to illustrate mechanisms underlying PVTT formation and tumor metastasis, and identified potential targets for clinical intervention. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Multi-omics data of 159 HCC patients (including 37 cases with PVTT) was analyzed to identify contributors to PVTT formation and tumor metastasis. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to confirm the critical role of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) in HCC metastasis. Metabolomics and transcriptomics techniques, single-cell RNA sequencing, combined with experimental verification were complemented to illustrate mechanisms underlying CAD induced pro-metastatic efficacy. Analysis of proteogenomic data of HCC cohort identified CAD as the key contributor to PVTT formation and tumor metastasis in HCC. Further experiments confirmed that high CAD expression could significantly promote HCC metastasis, and vice versa. Mechanistically, CAD manipulated de novo pyrimidine anabolism, leading to dihydroorotic acid (DHO) accumulation which directly bound to ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B). UBE4B subsequently regulated JAK1 ubiquitination and activated the NF-κB pathway to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Additionally, CAD generated an immunosuppressive milieu conducive to HCC metastasis by recruiting and reprogramming macrophages into a ""pro-tumor"" phenotype. Consequently, the metastatic capability of HCC was remarkably enhanced. CONCLUSION: Therapy targeting CAD may offer a promising approach to curb HCC metastasis by reducing tumor cells' metastatic potential and also shifting the tumor microenvironment towards a less pro-metastatic state.

It often presents with renal colic, which is characterised by acute and intense abdominal pain. The first step in the management of renal colic is pain control. Various medications, including narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antispasmodics, and others, have been used for this condition. NSAIDs are amongst the most commonly used drugs for renal colic. They act by reducing inflammation and lowering the pressure inside the urinary collecting system. This review updates a previous Cochrane Systematic Review (Afshar 2015), focusing exclusively on NSAIDs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the management of pain in adults with acute renal colic. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, trial registries, and conference proceedings up to 25 August 2023. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of NSAIDs in the management of renal colic adult patients (i.e. study participants over 16 years of age). We included studies that compared NSAIDs versus placebo, one NSAID versus another, or different doses or routes of administration of the same NSAID. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes included pain up to one hour after treatment as measured by a validated patient-reported tool, the need for rescue medication up to six hours after treatment, and serious adverse events up to one week after treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain recurrence, significant pain relief, and minor adverse events. We performed meta-analysis using the random-effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Our search identified 29 RCTs for inclusion in the review. The 29 studies involved a total of 3593 participants who were randomly allocated to treatment with an NSAID or placebo. The mean age of participants ranged from 27 to 47 years across the studies. Participants used a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the extent of their pain. NSAIDs versus placebo NSAIDs may reduce renal colic pain in 30 minutes compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -3.84 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.41 to -1.27; I(2) = 95%; 3 studies, 250 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of NSAIDs on the need for rescue medication (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.53; I(2) = 73%; 4 studies, 280 participants; very low-certainty evidence). NSAID versus NSAID Piroxicam may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD 0.01 cm, 95% CI -1.50 to 1.52; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 144 participants; low-certainty evidence). Parecoxib likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to ketoprofen (MD 0.03 cm, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.65; 1 study, 337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Lornoxicam likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to other NSAIDs (MD -0.22 cm, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.24; I² = 12%; 2 studies, 170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ketorolac may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 60 minutes (MD 0.23 cm, 95% CI -1.16 to 1.62, 1 study, 57 participants; low-certainty evidence) and need for rescue medication within 120 minutes (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.24; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to diclofenac. Intravenous (IV) ketorolac may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to IV ibuprofen (MD 1.36 cm, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.87; I² = 84%; 2 studies, 361 participants; low-certainty evidence). IV ketorolac may result in less chance of significant pain relief within 30 minutes compared to IV ibuprofen (RR 0.17, 95 CI 0.04 to 0.73; 1 study, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ketoprofen likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD -0.43 cm, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.32; 1 study, 80 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ketoprofen on significant pain relief within 40 minutes compared to diclofenac (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.78; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Indomethacin likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD 0.20 cm, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.30; 1 study, 83 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Pirprofen may result in a large reduction in the need for rescue medication within 30 minutes compared to indomethacin (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.82; 1 study, 205 participants; low-certainty evidence). Intravenous NSAIDs likely result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to intramuscular NSAIDs (MD -0.34 cm, 95% CI -1.19 to 0.51; I(2) = 42%; 2 studies, 134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Intravenous NSAIDs may reduce the need for rescue medication within 30 minutes compared to rectal NSAIDs (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.88; 1 study, 116 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain regarding the potential harms of NSAIDs. Risk of bias We judged the risk of bias in the studies to be moderate to high. This was due to a high proportion of unknown risk judgments for concealment bias and a high risk of selective reporting bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs may reduce pain in adult patients with renal colic compared to placebo. Comparing one NSAID against another, IV ketorolac may be less effective than IV ibuprofen, and pirprofen may result in less need for rescue medication than indomethacin. The intravenous route of administration is probably similar to the intramuscular route but may be better than the rectal route. The evidence is uncertain regarding the potential harms of NSAIDs. We were not able to perform subgroup analysis based on our predefined criteria because there were no eligible studies. ",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,

PURPOSE: Inhibition of glycolysis has been demonstrated to be effective in treating experimental idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This research seeks to explore the impact of aerobic glycolysis on the mitigation of pulmonary fibrosis through ECC-JHF. METHODS: A pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was generated through the administration of bleomycin (Bleomycin). The degree of pulmonary fibrosis was analyzed through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as well as Masson's trichrome staining. Western Blot (WB), Immunofluorescence (IF), and real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay for fibroblast activation markers and glycolysis-related genes in lung tissues. The Lactic Acid (LA) Content Assay Kit was employed to quantify lactate concentrations in lung tissues and fibroblast cultures. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was applied to detect lactylated modified protein levels, and mass spectrometry (MS) was used to analyze lactate substrate profiles in fibroblasts. WB was employed to detect the lactate modification level of histone H3K18 (H3K18la). The targets of ECC-JHF were analyzed using network pharmacology, while molecular docking and cellular enthusiasm transfer analysis (CETSA) examined the binding of ECC-JHF to SRC. The influence of ECC-JHF on SRC activation was assessed using WB. SRC small interfering RNA (siSRC) was designed and transfected into L929 cells to validate the function of SRC in the inhibition of fibroblast activation by ECC-JHF. RESULTS: In BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice, ECC-JHF significantly reduced alveolar inflammation and collagen deposition. In lung tissues and fibroblasts, ECC-JHF notably inhibited the expression of HK2, lactate levels, and lactylated modifying proteins. IP-MS and WB analyses showed that ECC-JHF significantly reduced H3K18la levels. Network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and CETSA results indicated that SRC serves as a key target for ECC-JHF. siSRC effectively mitigated the impact of ECC-JHF on the expression of HK2, levels of H3K18la, and the activation of fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: ECC-JHF may improve pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting SRC activation, blocking HK2-mediated lactate production, down-regulating H3K18la levels, and inhibiting fibroblast activation.

As a mitochondrial isozyme of creatine kinases, which control energy metabolism, CKMT1 is thought to be a critical molecule in biological processes. However, the specific role of CKMT1 in intestinal inflammation remains largely unknown.

We generated intestinal epithelial-specific CKMT1 knockout mice and demonstrated the key role of CKMT1 in mitochondrial homeostasis, intestinal epithelial barrier function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. In the in vitro experiments, CKMT1 expression limited the activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in IECs. Mechanistically, the loss of CKMT1 expression in IECs increased TNF-α-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via reverse electron transfer (RET). RET-ROS promoted mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, ultimately resulting in cell apoptosis during intestinal inflammation.

However, TAT may increase the risk of hemorrhage. There is a dearth of data regarding the risks of bleeding with various oral anticoagulants in TAT in comparison with DAPT and individual anticoagulants and antiplatelets due to which we carried out the present study examining the real-world pharmacovigilance data. METHODS: Data were extracted from the USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) from March 2004 to June 2024 using the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) code for ""haemorrhages."" We employed the ""case-non-case"" approach in disproportionality analysis to detect safety signals for hemorrhage among anticoagulant, antiplatelet, dual antiplatelet and triple antithrombotic combinations. Reports including combinations of DAPT (acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel) with oral anticoagulants (acenocoumarol, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin) were analyzed. Signal detection used both frequentist (reporting odds ratio [ROR], proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian (Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker algorithms. The lower limit of 95% confidence interval of ROR above 1 indicates higher reporting risk of bleeding. Following outcomes were evaluated for each TAT: death, disability and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 20,626 unique reports, 812 involved TAT, 3,820 DAPT, and 15,995 individual antiplatelets. Most cases occurred in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with a predominance of male patients. Rivaroxaban combined with DAPT presented the highest hemorrhage signal (ROR: 82.84; 95% CI, 60.77-112.92), while apixaban showed the lowest (ROR: 13.11; 95% CI, 9.39-18.3) and the other anticoagulants are as follows: warfarin (ROR: 15.96; 95% CI: 18.36), dabigatran (ROR: 27.32; 95% CI: 20.03-37.26) and acenocoumarol (ROR: 43.98; 95% CI: 17.21-112.4). Mortality and hospitalization rates varied significantly among treatments, with rivaroxaban linked to the highest mortality. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the elevated hemorrhage risk associated with TAT, particularly with rivaroxaban, while apixaban appears safer in terms of bleeding and mortality. These findings underscore the need for cautious monitoring of bleeding outcomes with anticoagulant regimens, particularly rivaroxaban combinations for optimizing patient outcomes.

While physical activity has been linked to cognitive enhancement, the specific effects of intermittent short bouts of exercise, termed 'exercise snacks' (ES), on cognitive function (CF) in older adults are not well understood. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2549 adults aged ≥60 years from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles. CF was assessed using standardized tests, and physical activity data were obtained from accelerometer measurements. ES was defined as 2-5 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Regression analyses, smoothed curve fitting, and threshold effect analyses were conducted, adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Significant positive associations were found between CF and daily average Monitor-Independent Movement Summary specific to ES (MIMS-ES: β = 0.0001, 95 % CI: 0.0001-0.0001) and total time spent on ES (Time-ES: β = 0.0021, 95 % CI: 0.0014-0.0029). Each additional unit of MIMS-ES and each minute of ES daily increased CF scores by 0.0001 and 0.0021 points, respectively, suggesting benefits for cognitive health in aging populations. An inverted U-shaped relationship was observed, with inflection points at 2522.82 units/day for MIMS-ES and 91.57 min/day for Time-ES, indicating diminishing cognitive benefits beyond these thresholds. CONCLUSION: ES was associated with higher CF. This practical form of physical activity offers an effective strategy for cognitive health and mitigating age-related decline, presenting a more accessible alternative to traditional continuous exercise.

We showed that reducing PTPσ promotes the survival of both poly-GR- and poly-PR-expressing neurons by elevating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), accompanied by restored early endosomes and lysosomes. Remarkably, PTPσ knockdown or inhibition substantially rescues the PI3P-endolysosomal defects and improves the survival of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons. Furthermore, the PTPσ inhibitor diminishes GR toxicity and rescues pathological and behavioral phenotypes in mice. Overall, these findings emphasize the critical role of PI3P-mediated endolysosomal deficits induced by R-DPRs in disease pathogenesis and reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPσ in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD.

It can be found in a large number of agglutinating languages, such as Hungarian and Turkish, and it may apply both at the lexical level (i.e., within word stems) and at the morphological level (i.e., between stems and their affixes). Thus, it might affect both lexical and morphological development in infants whose native language has vowel harmony. The current study asked at what age infants learning an irregular harmonic language, Hungarian, become sensitive to vowel harmony within word stems. In a head-turn preference study, 13-month-old, but not 10-month-old, Hungarian-learning infants preferred listening to nonharmonic VCV (vowel-consonant-vowel) pseudowords over vowel-harmonic ones. A control experiment with 13-month-olds exposed to French, a nonharmonic language, showed no listening preference for either of the sequences, suggesting that this finding cannot be explained by a universal preference for nonharmonic sequences but rather reflects language-specific knowledge emerging between 10 and 13 months of age. We discuss the implications of this finding for morphological and lexical learning. ",Journal of experimental child psychology,

In 1993, the World Health Organisation declared TB a global emergency. Passive case-finding is an important part of TB control programmes, and this is strongly affected by people's perceptions and beliefs of TB and society's behaviour towards TB sufferers. The aim of this study was to describe the perceptions and beliefs of Vietnamese people regarding TB and its risk factors with special reference to differences between men and women. Sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) were organised in four districts representing different regions in Vietnam and consisting of men and women, TB patients and non-TB participants. In general, participants had good knowledge of TB being a dangerous, contagious and infectious disease, caused by germs. However, traditional beliefs in different types of TB still exist, mainly among older people in rural areas, but also resorted to by other people once ill. Four main types of TB were reported: (1) 'Lao truyen' (hereditary TB), handed down from older generations to latter ones through 'family blood', regardless of sexes; (2) 'Lao luc' (physical TB), caused by hard work, more men affected; (3) 'Lao tam' (mental TB), caused by too much worrying-more women affected; and (4) 'Lao phoi' (lung TB), dangerous and caused by TB germs, transmitted through the respiratory system-more men affected. Other general risk factors were also mentioned. Men were perceived to get TB more often than women, as they were more exposed to risk factors during both work and leisure time. These traditional beliefs may contribute to long delays to TB diagnosis and increased social stigma and isolation of TB patients and their families due to erroneous beliefs in transmission routes. Our findings demonstrate areas where TB control programmes may be improved. ",Social science & medicine (1982),

There was no difference in the level of discomfort based on discomfort location (f = -0.14; P = 0.71). The discomfort locations support the notion that ETT irritation occurs at multiple levels (i.e. pharyngeal, laryngeal, and tracheal mucosal areas).

In two phase 3 trials, twice-yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir was safe and highly efficacious for PrEP in diverse populations. Furthering long-acting PrEP efforts, this study assessed the pharmacokinetics and safety of two once-yearly intramuscular lenacapavir formulations. METHODS: This phase 1, open-label study in participants aged 18-55 years without HIV evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of two lenacapavir free acid formulations administered by ventrogluteal intramuscular injection as a single 5000 mg dose (formulation 1 with 5% w/w ethanol, formulation 2 with 10% w/w ethanol). Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at prespecified timepoints up to 56 weeks. Lenacapavir plasma concentrations were measured with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method and summarised with non-compartmental analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated included the area under the concentration-time curve for the once-yearly dosing interval calculated from days 1 to 365 (AUC(days 1-365)), peak plasma concentration, time to reach peak plasma concentration, and trough concentration (C(trough)). Plasma concentration data from phase 3 studies of twice-yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir (PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2) were pooled for comparison with once-yearly intramuscular lenacapavir formulations. Safety and tolerability, including participant-reported pain scores, were assessed. FINDINGS: 20 participants received lenacapavir formulation 1 and 20 received lenacapavir formulation 2. For estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters, sample size varied over time with at least 13 participants (formulation 1) and at least 19 participants (formulation 2) due to early discontinuations for reasons unrelated to the study drug. Following administration of intramuscular lenacapavir, concentrations increased rapidly, and median time to maximum concentration was 84·1 days (IQR 56·1-112·0) for formulation 1 and 69·9 days (55·3-105·5) for formulation 2. The highest median concentration of once-yearly intramuscular lenacapavir (247·0 ng/mL [IQR 184·0-346·0] for formulation 1, 336·0 ng/mL [233·5-474·3] for formulation 2) remained above the highest median twice-yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir concentration (67·3 ng/mL [46·8-91·4]). Median C(trough) at the end of 52 weeks for formulation 1 was 57·0 ng/mL (IQR 49·9-72·4) and for formulation 2 was 65·6 ng/mL (41·8-87·1), exceeding the median twice-yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir C(trough) of 23·4 ng/mL (15·7-34·3) at the end of 26 weeks. Median AUC(days 1-365) for formulation 1 was 1011·1 h*μg/mL (IQR 881·0-1490·2) and for formulation 2 was 1274·0 h*μg/mL (1177·3-1704·8). Adverse events were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common was injection-site pain (16 [80%] participants given formulation 1, 15 [75%] given formulation 2), which was generally mild, resolved within 1 week, and was substantially reduced by pretreatment with ice. INTERPRETATION: Following administration of once-yearly intramuscular lenacapavir, median plasma concentrations exceeded those associated with efficacy in phase 3 studies of twice-yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir for PrEP for at least 56 weeks. Both formulations were safe and well tolerated. These data show the potential for biomedical HIV prevention with a once-yearly dosing interval. FUNDING: Gilead Sciences.

Mild cognitive impairment, a clinical state between normal aging and AD, may offer the proper window for AD intervention and treatment. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) studies exploring factors attributable to AD and related cognitive status and to assess its credibility. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library to identify MR studies investigating the associations between any factor and AD and related cognitive status. The risk of bias in MR studies was evaluated using nine signaling questions tailored to identify potential biases based on the STROBE-MR guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 125 eligible publications were examined, including 106 AD-related MR studies reporting 674 records and 28 cognition-related MR studies reporting 141 records. We identified 185 unique causal risk factors for AD and 49 for cognitive status. More than half of the MR studies reporting AD or cognitive status outcomes exhibited poor methodological quality, with a high risk of bias observed in 59% of the AD-related studies and 64% of the cognitive-related studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review summarized modifiable factors and omics signatures, providing a database of MR studies on AD and related cognitive status. The evaluation of bias risk in MR studies serves to raise awareness and improve overall quality. A critical appraisal checklist for assessing the risk of bias may pave the way for the development of a standardized tool.

We verify the function of TaCAT2 regulating wheat FCR resistance by genetic transformation. Moreover, we screen a sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase alpha subunit (TaSnRK1α) interacting with TaCAT2, and subsequently find that TaSnRK1α phosphorylates TaCAT2. We next identify an FCR-resistance haplotype TaCAT2(Ser214), and confirm that Ser214 of TaCAT2 is a key phosphorylation site for TaSnRK1α. We also find that TaSnRK1α results in higher protein accumulation in TaCAT2(Ser214) than in TaCAT2(Thr214), which possibly contribute to scavenging ROS (reactive oxygen species) in TaCAT2(Ser214) wheat plants. Furthermore, the function of TaSnRK1α regulating FCR resistance is verified by genetic transformation. Taken together, we propose a TaSnRK1α-TaCAT2 model to mediate FCR resistance by scavenging the ROS in wheat plants. ",Nature communications,

While widely used as a fundamental organic chemical intermediate in various household products, MA's potential for unexpected toxicological synergy with its homolog, cyanuric acid (CA), remains a concern. This study aimed to investigate the nephrotoxicity of combined melamine and cyanuric acid (MC) exposure and its underlying mechanisms in rats through an integrative approach, combining network toxicology (NT), bioinformatics, and experimental validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were exposed to MC at doses of 0/0 mg/kg/day (Control) and 63/63 mg/kg/day (MC) for four weeks. Kidney pathology, injury markers, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes between the two groups. Bioinformatics analysis, including pathway enrichment and immune microenvironment analysis, was conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MC-induced kidney injury. Potential target proteins were identified using ChEMBL, STITCH, and GeneCards databases, and hub genes were screened using three machine learning algorithms: LASSO regression, Random Forest, and Molecular Complex Detection. Molecular docking simulations were performed to assess the interactions between MC and the identified hub genes. RESULTS: MC exposure resulted in severe kidney morphological and histological changes, as well as elevated levels of kidney injury and fibrosis markers. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant enrichment of immuno-inflammatory and apoptosis-related pathways in the MC group. Immune microenvironment analysis confirmed the infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells. Network toxicology analysis identified 20 potential targets associated with MC-induced kidney injury. Two hub genes, Ren and Casp3, were identified as key regulators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and apoptosis, respectively. Further experimental validation, including Western blotting and immunofluorescence, confirmed the upregulation of these proteins. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated strong binding affinities between MC and the two hub proteins. CONCLUSION: MC exposure induces significant kidney injury and fibrosis. The activation of the RAAS pathway and apoptosis plays a crucial role in MC-mediated nephrotoxicity. However, additional vivo experimental validation is lacking. Future studies should focus on further exploration for the mechanism of MC-induced nephrotoxicity and more rigorous experimental validation. ",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,

However, research on the relationship between iron status and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is quite limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the connection between iron status and DKD. METHODS AND RESULTS: This population-based cross-sectional survey included adult diabetes patients from five National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles spanning 1999 to 2006 and 2017 to 2018. Regression models were used to assess the impact of iron status on the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy. Restricted cubic spline models further explored potential nonlinear dose-response relationships. Subgroup analyses clarified the effects of other covariates on these associations. Iron and TIBC were negatively correlated with DKD, albuminuria, and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). TSAT was negatively correlated with DKD and showed an ""L""-shaped nonlinear correlation with albuminuria and low-eGFR. Ferritin exhibited a ""J""-shaped nonlinear correlation with DKD, albuminuria, and low-eGFR. Subgroup analysis revealed that the association between TIBC and reduced risk of low eGFR was more pronounced in individuals with hypertension. The associations between iron and TSAT with a reduced risk of DKD were more significant in smokers, while the association between ferritin and an increased risk of albuminuria was also more pronounced in smokers.

Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are major risk factors for CKD, and CKD is associated with cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Understanding the prevalence and burden of CKD is essential for the development of prevention and control strategies. METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 study, this study analyzed the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of CKD at global, regional, and national levels between 1990 and 2021. Decomposition analysis, health inequalities and frontier analysis were used to analyse the changes. RESULTS: This study analyzed the global regional and national burden, trends, and disparities of CKD from 1990 to 2021 and found that the global burden of CKD had increased significantly, in line with trends in population ageing and population growth, and with significant variations between regions. There were 673.7 million people with CKD worldwide in 2021, accounting for 8.54% of the global population, a 92.0% increase from 1990. Despite a slight decline in age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), the absolute number of CKD cases increased. Central Asia had the highest prevalence of CKD, while Central Latin America had the highest rate of DALYs and incidence for CKD. In 2021, At the national level, China had the highest number of new CKD cases. The country with the highest ASPR and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) of CKD was Mauritius. Globally, age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and ASDR were on the rise in almost all countries/regions, suggesting that the impact of CKD on global health is increasing. Population growth and ageing were major factors contributing to the increasing burden of CKD, especially in China and low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions. In addition, the cross-national study of health inequalities in CKD showed that, although there have been improvements in global health over time, health inequalities continue to exist. The frontier analysis revealed a considerable degree of heterogeneity in the effective differences across the spectrum of socio-demographic indices. CONCLUSION: CKD is a global health problem, the burden of which varies between regions and countries. A multifaceted approach is necessary to prevent and control CKD, including population-level interventions targeting risk factors, improvements in the accessibility and quality of health care, and measures to address health inequalities.

METHODS: Overall, 24,006 individuals aged 20 and above were enrolled in the research, drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Individuals in the study was classified into three distinct categories according to the level of fasting plasma glucose or glycated haemoglobin: normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, and DM. Multivariate logistic regression models and smoothed curve-fitting techniques were applied to investigate the correlation between CMI and ASCVD risk across varying GMS. Additionally, subgroup analyses stratified by relevant factors were performed to identify potential effect modifiers in this relationship. RESULTS: Overall, 2352 participants (9.8%) with ASCVD were included. An increasing trend in ASCVD risk was observed for each successive CMI tertile. After adjusting for all related covariates, a significantly positive association was observed between CMI and ASCVD (P = 0.0004).

Pathogenic variants in Mediator subunits typically lead to neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders with variable clinical presentations, designated as MEDopathies. Here, we report the identification of 25 individuals from 18 families with bi-allelic MED16 variants who have a multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs)-intellectual disability syndrome. Intellectual disability, speech delay, and/or motor delay of variable severity were constant and associated with variable combinations of craniofacial defects (micro/retrognathia, cleft palate, and preauricular tags), anomalies of the extremities, and heart defects (predominantly tetralogy of Fallot). Visual impairment, deafness, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities were also frequent. The 26 variants identified were comprised of eight predicted protein-truncating (three intragenic deletions, two frameshifts, and one nonsense and two essential splice site variants) and 18 missense or in-frame duplication variants affecting conserved residues, without clear correlation between phenotypic severity and variant type combination. Three-dimensional modeling indicated that the missense and duplication variants likely have a destabilizing effect on the structural elements of the protein. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated protein mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for 16 of the 17 variants studied. Homozygous mutant med16 zebrafish presented growth delay and increased mortality compared with wild-type fish, and Med16 knockout mice are preweaning lethal, highlighting the conserved requirement of MED16 for development. Overall, we describe an autosomal recessive MCAs-intellectual disability MEDopathy, emphasizing the importance of Mediator during neurodevelopment and suggesting that some tissues are particularly sensitive to the loss of certain subunits.

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine targeting serogroups A, C, Y, W, and X (NmCV-5) relative to a licensed, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) when co-administered with routine childhood vaccines at ages 9 months and 15 months. METHODS: In this single-centre, double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial, children aged 9-11 months who had completed their local infant Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines were recruited at the Centre pour le Développement des Vaccins in Bamako, Mali. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1·2) at their 9-month EPI visits to receive a meningococcal vaccine at either their 9-month or 15-month EPI vaccination visits. At each participant's designated EPI visit, they were randomly assigned a second time (2:1) to receive either NmCV-5 or MenACWY-TT. Study vaccines and designated EPI vaccines were prepared and administered by assigned unmasked study personnel. Parents or guardians, investigators, and all other trial staff were masked to meningococcal vaccine assignments. The meningococcal vaccines were co-administered with a measles and rubella vaccine (first dose) and a yellow fever vaccine at age 9 months or with a measles and rubella vaccine (second dose) at age 15 months. The primary endpoint, seroprotective response, was defined as a rabbit complement serum bactericidal antibody titre of 8 or higher, with the estimand, given as the difference in the proportions of participants for each of the five meningococcal serogroups who showed this response 28 days after vaccination, assessed in the per-protocol population. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was -10% for all five serogroups in both age groups. The non-inferiority of the NmCV-5 seroprotective response to serogroup X was evaluated in comparison with the lowest seroprotective response for MenACWY-TT among serogroups A, C, W, or Y. Safety was a secondary endpoint, assessed over 6 months in a modified intention-to-treat population that included all participants who received a randomly assigned meningococcal vaccine. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05093829. FINDINGS: Between March 24 and Aug 15, 2022, 1325 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a meningococcal vaccine at either age 9 months (n=602) or age 15 months (n=723). Meningococcal vaccines were administered to 600 of the 602 participants assigned to the 9-month vaccination group during that same period. Between Sept 27, 2022, and Feb 6, 2023, 600 participants received meningococcal vaccines at their 15-month visits. In both groups, 400 participants received NmCV-5 and 200 participants received MenACWY-TT. The per-protocol population assessed in the non-inferiority analysis included 564 participants vaccinated at age 9 months (373 who received NmCV-5 and 191 who received MenACWY-TT) and 549 participants vaccinated at age 15 months (367 who received NmCV-5 and 182 who received MenACWY-TT). Among the participants in the per-protocol population who received NmCV-5 at age 9 months, the difference in seroprotection prevalence for NmCV-5 relative to MenACWY-TT was 0·0% (95% CI -1·0 to 2·0) for serogroup A, -0·5% (-2·3 to 1·9) for serogroup C, -3·0% (-6·3 to 0·8) for serogroup W, and -3·0% (-5·4 to -0·4) for serogroup Y. For serogroup X, non-inferiority was assessed relative to seroprotection for serogroup W in participants who received MenACWY-TT, with a difference of 2·3% (95% CI 0·3 to 4·7). The difference in the prevalence of seroprotection among the participants who received NmCV-5 at age 15 months relative to participants who received MenACWY-TT at age 15 months was 0·8% (95% CI -0·6 to 3·7) for serogroup A, -0·8% (-3·3 to 2·5) for serogroup C, 0·3% (-1·8 to 3·5) for serogroup W, and 1·4% (-0·6 to 4·8) for serogroup Y. For serogroup X, non-inferiority was assessed in relation to seroprotection for serogroup Y in participants who received MenACWY-TT, with a difference of 1·9% (95% CI 0·0 to 4·4). NmCV-5 responses in both age groups were non-inferior to MenACWY-TT responses for all five serogroups. Six serious adverse events were recorded but none were deemed related to vaccination. INTERPRETATION: When compared with a licensed, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, and given alongside other routine vaccines, a single dose of NmCV-5 was safe and elicited a non-inferior immune response in infants aged 9 months and young children aged 15 months.

Defects in this gene have been implicated in immunodeficiency. OBJECTIVE: To deepen the understanding of the clinical implications of IRF2BP2 variants, we sought to clinically characterize and functionally test thirty-four individuals with IRF2BP2 variants. METHODS: We collected 34 subjects across 18 families with mutations in IRF2BP2. Records were abstracted for clinical phenotypes. Functional testing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) luciferase gene reporter constructs and quantitative cDNA determinations were used to evaluate repressor activity associated with ectopic expression of various IRF2BP2 mutant constructs in Jurkat cells. RESULTS: Most subjects had immunodeficiency (91%, n = 30/33) with variable gastrointestinal (65%, n= 20/31) and inflammatory or autoimmune features (57%, n=17/30), including chronic abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, constipation, vitiligo, alopecia, and migratory rashes. There was a reduced frequency of memory B-cells with poor immunoglobulin production and reduced calcium flux in response to B-cell receptor stimuli. PBMCs had increased apoptosis in vitro compared to healthy controls. Impaired IRF2BP2 repression of NFAT activation was observed using patient-derived mutant IRF2BP2 constructs compared to wild-type. Similarly, TNF-α transcript levels were higher using patient-derived mutations compared to wild-type IRF2BP2 constructs. CONCLUSIONS: IRF2BP2 deficiency causes a complex immunodeficiency including gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders as well as impaired B-cell maturation. Impaired repression of the NFAT pathway appears to enhance proinflammatory signaling through proinflammatory cytokine expression. ",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,

","Zhou, Nan, Bai, Hongjing, Zhang, Ziyan, Yu, Baofeng, Zhao, Hong, Li, Jinbo, Zheng, Guoping","BACKGROUND: Identifying the past and future burden of kidney cancer (KC) and its temporal trends among older adults (≥ 65 years) at global, regional, and national levels is critical for effective prevention strategies. METHODS: The age-standardized incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study from 1990 to 2021. These indicators were stratified by sex, age, and socio-demographic index (SDI). The correlation between these indicators and SDI was assessed. Temporal trends were quantified using the annual average percentage change (AAPC), and future trends from 2022 to 2040 were predicted using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of KC among older adults increased from 21.73 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 26.74 per 100,000 people in 2021, with an AAPC of 0.67%. Age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) remained stable, while significant increases were observed in age-standardized prevalence (AAPC = 1.24%, 95%CI: 1.14-1.34%) and mortality rate (AAPC = 0.13%, 95%CI: 0.05-0.22%). From 1990 to 2021, males consistently exhibited a higher disease burden than females, additionally, the ASIR of KC increased significantly in all age subgroups. Regions with higher SDI levels also showed a greater disease burden, while Oceania had the lowest burden of KC in 2021. The ASIR increased in almost all countries and territories. Czechia showed the highest ASIR (92.25 per 100,000 people) and ASDR (819.88 per 100,000 people). Smoking and high body mass index (BMI) remained significant risk factors for DALYs and mortality in the older population, and their effects were greatest in high SDI region. Furthermore, the burden of KC is expected to continue to decline through 2040. CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of KC among older adults increased from 1990 to 2021, with notable regional and national variations. However, it is projected to continue to decline through 2040. The management of smoking and high BMI remain major challenges for people with KC, necessitating targeted clinical guidelines, particularly focusing on males and the older adults. ",BMC cancer,

By integrating transcriptome-wide binding approaches and functional assays, we show that the conserved Imp RNA binding protein controls the transport of mRNAs to Mushroom Body axons and characterize a mutant in which this transport is selectively impaired.

Fatty acid synthase (Fasn)-mediated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is one of the major lipid metabolic pathways and has been shown to play critical roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes. However, little is known about its role in osteoclastogenesis. Here, we investigate the direct role of DNL in osteoclastogenesis and its therapeutic potential in osteolytic diseases. We found that Fasn expression and DNL levels are upregulated during receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. Inhibition of Fasn by shRNA knockdown or its pharmacological inhibitors (ASC40 and trans-C75) impairs osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Mechanistically, pharmacological inhibition of Fasn suppresses RANKL-induced c-Fos/NFATc1 expression and thus osteoclastogenesis partly by disrupting STAT3 palmitoylation, while promoting ROS scavenging to impair mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Finally, the therapeutic potential of ASC40 for the treatment of osteolytic bone loss is tested in two mouse models of osteolytic diseases, i.e. ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis and titanium nanoparticle-induced calvarial osteolysis. The results show that ASC40 significantly attenuates bone loss and osteoclastogenesis in both models. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Fasn-mediated DNL is a novel positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoclast-driven osteolytic bone diseases.

Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in VSMCs plays a pivotal role because it constitutes an essential osteogenic transcription factor for bone formation. As a key DNA demethylation enzyme, ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) is crucial in maintaining the VSMC phenotype. However, whether TET2 involves in VC progression remains elusive. Here we identified a substantial downregulation of TET2 in calcified human and mouse arteries, as well as human primary VSMCs. In vitro gain- and loss-of function experiments demonstrated TET2 regulated VC. Subsequently, in vivo knockdown of TET2 significantly exacerbated VC in both vitamin D3 and adenine-diet-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice models. Mechanistically, TET2 binds to and suppresses the activity of the P2 promoter within the RUNX2 gene, whereas an enzymatic loss-of-function mutation of TET2 has a comparable effect. Furthermore, TET2 forms a complex with histone deacetylases 1/2 (HDAC1/2 ) to deacetylate H3K27ac on the P2 promoter, thereby inhibiting its transcription. Moreover, SNIP1 is indispensable for TET2 to interact with HDAC1/2 to exert inhibitory effect on VC, and knockdown of SNIP1 accelerated VC in mice. Collectively, our findings imply that TET2 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for VC. ",The Journal of clinical investigation,

BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) belongs to the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) family, which plays an important role in cell metabolism and cell death, but its role in early brain injury (EBI) after SAH requires further study. Forkhead box protein O3a (FOXO3a) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of cellular function and survival in the nervous system, including the oxidative stress response and neuronal death. This study aimed to explore the effect of FOXO3a and BAP1 on neuronal ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of EBI after SAH. In this study, the overexpression of BAP1 significantly inhibited GPX4 expression and exacerbated the degree of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in neurons after SAH. BAP1 regulated the transcription level of the SLC7A11 promoter by H2Aub. FOXO3a could transcriptionally regulate BAP1 to influence the levels of SLC7A11 and GPX4, and mediate lipid peroxidation and neuronal ferroptosis after SAH. Silencing FOXO3 and BAP1 significantly improved neurological deficit and cerebral edema, and reduced oxidative stress damage in SAH mice. After SAH, BAP1 could directly bind to the FKH-DBD + NLS domain located in FOXO3a protein through the UCH domain, and mediates deubiquitination of FOXO3a protein by the K48 site to maintain the stability of FOXO3a. Our findings elucidate the impact of FOXO3a and BAP1 on SLC7A11-related ferroptosis following SAH both in vivo and in vitro, and the inhibition of the FOXO3a-BAP1 axis can significantly attenuate neuronal damage and ferroptosis in EBI after SAH.

Studies evaluated serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; eight studies), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; two studies), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; 14 studies), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs; two studies), or 'other antidepressants' (two studies). All studies were placebo-controlled. Outcomes were measured at short-term follow-up in 73% of studies. All included studies had at least one domain judged at high risk of bias, with 69% at high risk of attrition bias. Non-specific low back pain (benefits) Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated that SNRIs probably have a small effect on pain intensity (mean difference (MD) (0 to 100 scale) -5.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.17 to -3.34; I(2) = 0; 4 studies, 1415 participants) and a trivial effect on disability (MD (0 to 24 scale) -0.91, 95% CI -1.30 to -0.51; I(2) = 0; 4 studies, 1348 participants) at short-term follow-up. Low-certainty evidence showed that SSRIs may have little to no effect on pain intensity (MD 1.20, 95% CI -4.90 to 7.30; I(2) = 0; 3 studies, 199 participants) and disability (MD -2.20 (0 to 100 scale), 95% CI -8.11 to 3.71; 1 study, 92 participants) at short-term follow-up. Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated that TCAs probably have little to no effect on pain intensity (MD -2.00, 95% CI -7.25 to 3.24; I² = 31%; 4 studies, 417 participants), but probably have a small effect on disability (MD (0 to 24 scale) -1.76, 95% CI -2.70 to -0.82; I(2) = 0; 3 studies, 330 participants) at short-term follow-up. The effects of TeCAs (MD -4.50, 95% CI -17.59 to 8.59; 1 study, 52 participants) and other antidepressants (MD -5.40, 95% CI -23.08 to 12.28; 1 study, 39 participants) on pain intensity at short-term follow-up are unclear (very low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of TeCAs or other antidepressants on disability. Spine-related leg pain (benefits) The effects of SNRIs on pain intensity (MD -46.10, 95% CI -89.29 to -2.91; 1 study, 11 participants) and disability (MD (0 to 100 scale) -4.40, 95% CI -20.25 to 11.45; 1 study, 11 participants) at short-term follow-up are very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence showed TCAs may have a large effect on pain intensity at short-term follow-up (MD -23.00, 95% CI -32.12 to -13.88; 1 study, 60 participants), and a moderate effect on disability (MD (0 to 100 scale) -13.00, 95% CI -19.42 to -6.58; 1 study, 60 participants). There were no studies that assessed the effects of SSRIs, TeCAs, or other antidepressants in people with spine-related leg pain. Non-specific low back pain and spine-related leg pain (harms) Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated that SNRIs probably increase the risk of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.27; I(2) = 0%; 5 studies, 1510 participants), but it is unclear whether they increase the risk of serious adverse events (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.75, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.89; 5 studies, 1510 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether TCAs increase the risk of adverse events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.90; 7 studies, 474 participants; low-certainty evidence) or serious adverse events (Peto OR 6.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 106.72; I² = 0%; 1 study, 142 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether SSRIs (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.14 to 24.19; I² = 95%; 2 studies, 107 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or TeCAs increase the risk of adverse events (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09; 1 study, 52 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the risk of serious adverse events for these classes. No studies measured total adverse events for other antidepressants. It is unclear whether other antidepressants increase the risk of serious adverse events (Peto OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.16 to 4.96; 1 study, 42 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found that in people with non-specific low back pain, SNRIs probably have small effects on pain intensity, trivial effects on disability, and are probably associated with adverse effects. TCAs probably do not reduce low back pain intensity, but may have a small effect on disability. The effects of antidepressants on spine-related leg pain are uncertain, though SNRIs and TCAs might be prioritised over other classes for future investigations. Evidence for the safety of SSRIs, TCAs, TeCAs, and other antidepressants in non-specific low back pain and spine-related leg pain remains unclear. ",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,

Japan and the United States offer contrasting approaches to addressing this issue, presenting a valuable opportunity for comparative analysis. OBJECTIVE: This review examines the effectiveness of public health policies, cultural dietary habits, and lifestyle factors in combating childhood obesity in Japan and the United States. It aims to identify actionable insights to inform global strategies for obesity prevention. RESULTS: Japan exhibits one of the lowest childhood obesity rates globally, attributed to prevention-focused policies such as the food education program, stringent school lunch standards, and culturally ingrained healthy eating practices. These efforts are complemented by active lifestyle promotion through urban planning and school-based physical education programs. In contrast, the United States faces higher obesity rates due to systemic challenges, including socioeconomic disparities, reliance on processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, and inconsistent implementation of federal programs like the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed). CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights Japan's success in aligning public health initiatives with cultural norms to achieve sustainable outcomes. In the United States, systemic barriers and cultural disconnects hinder obesity prevention efforts. Recommendations include adopting integrated, prevention-focused policies, addressing socioeconomic inequities, redesigning urban environments to promote active living, and fostering global collaboration. This comparative analysis underscores the importance of culturally tailored, multidimensional strategies for addressing childhood obesity and improving public health outcomes worldwide. ",Nutrients,

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in modulating cardiac outcomes. Here, the cardioprotective effects of a commensal bacterium Flavonifractor plautii (F. plautii) and its metabolite desaminotyrosine (DAT) against myocardial I/R injury are investigated. We showed that prophylactic gavage of F. plautii attenuates myocardial I/R injury as evidenced by improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac injury. We also found that its metabolite DAT recapitulates these cardioprotective effects against myocardial I/R injury. Transcriptomic analysis has revealed that DAT preserves cardiac tissue and attenuates immune responses against myocardial I/R injury. Mechanistically, DAT promotes cardiomyocyte survival through the modulation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)/NADPH) ratio. Further, DAT suppressed macrophage proinflammatory activities and cardiac inflammation via the reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. Taken together, our findings indicate that F. plautii and its metabolite DAT exert pleiotropic cardioprotective effects against myocardial I/R injury, suggesting them as potential prophylactic therapeutic options for alleviating myocardial I/R injury.

This connection arises from significant similarities in their pathological processes, including the regulation of cellular metabolism, inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and neural repair, all of which involve common biological factors. A significant shared feature of both diseases is the crucial role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in mediating intercellular communication. Extracellular vesicles, with their characteristic bilayer structure, encapsulate proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, shielding them from enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, deoxyribonucleases, and proteases. This structural protection facilitates long-distance intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. In gliomas, EVs are pivotal in intracranial signaling and shaping the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the cargos carried by glioma-derived EVs closely align with the biological factors involved in ischemic stroke, underscoring the substantial impact of glioma on stroke pathology, particularly through the crucial roles of EVs as key mediators in this interaction. This review explores the pathological interplay between glioma and ischemic stroke, addressing clinical manifestations and pathophysiological processes across the stages of hypoxia, stroke onset, progression, and recovery, with a particular focus on the crucial role of EVs and their cargos in these interactions.

As a result, cancers driven by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection have emerged as an increasingly important cause of mortality in this population. The complex interplay between HIV and HPV necessitates a deep understanding of the HPV-related cancer burden in people living with HIV and the integration of effective prevention strategies into their care. Although cervical cancer is a global concern, anal cancer is more important among people living with HIV in settings where HIV is more concentrated among men who have sex with men. High HPV prevalence, coupled with resource constraints, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of people living with HIV reside, creates substantial barriers to successful prevention and management of HPV-related malignancies. Implementing preventive measures, such as HPV vaccination and comprehensive screening programmes, is crucial and will require addressing existing health inequities and developing tailored interventions for people living with HIV. The development of enhanced secondary prevention tools and innovative treatment modalities is essential to mitigate the burden of HPV-associated cancers and improve the overall health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

However, the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain unclear. CBX3 promoted proliferation and metastasis in CRC. However, the role and mechanism of CBX3 in chemoresistance remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CBX3 on multidrug resistance in CRC. Our studies showed that higher levels of CBX3 expression were associated with poor survival, especially in groups with progression following chemotherapy. CBX3 overexpression increased Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin resistance, whereas CBX3 knockdown suppressed multidrug resistance in CRC cells. Additionally, CBX3 inhibited ferroptosis associated with multidrug resistance, and the ferroptosis activators prevented CBX3 overexpression-mediated cell survival. RNA sequencing revealed that the NRF2-signaling pathway was involved in this process. CBX3-upregulated NRF2 protein expression by directly binding to the promoter of Cullin3 (CUL3) to suppress CUL3 transcription and CUL3-mediated NRF2 degradation. Moreover, Glutathione Peroxidase 2 (GPX2) was downstream of the CBX3-NRF2 pathway in CRC chemoresistance. ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, suppressed GPX2 expression, and increased ferroptosis in PDX models. Our study identified CBX3/NRF2/GPX2 axis may be a novel signaling pathway that mediates multidrug resistance in CRC.

METHODS: Data on the incidence and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of DD among people aged 45-89 in China between 1992 and 2021 were collected from the GBD 2021. The age-period-cohort (APC) model was applied to determine the effects of age, period, and cohort on the incidence and DALY rates of DD. RESULTS: (1) Over the last 30 years, there was a 6.49% increase in the overall age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and a 3.99% increase in age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) for DD among middle-aged and older adults in China, with females consistently exhibiting higher ASIR and ASDR than males. In 2020, COVID-19 significantly increased the ASIR and ASDR of DD in the population, especially in females. (2) The APC analysis revealed an annual net drift of 0.38% in incidence and 0.17% in DALY rate. For both genders, local drifts of incidence were negative for the 45-54 age group and positive for the 55-89 age group; DALY rates showed negative local drifts for the 45-59 age group and positive for the 60-89 age group. (3) Incidence and DALY rates increased with age, displaying a trend of initial decline followed by an increase in period effects, but a trend of initial increase followed by a decrease in cohort effects. Moreover, the impacts of age, period, and cohort exhibited gender differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a comprehensive and in-depth perspective for studying the changing trends of DD's burden in China and for identifying targeted prevention and treatment policies for DD from different aspects.

Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens(3-8). However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1-IBR-RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus-host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding. ",Nature,

However, dysregulated copper metabolism in tumor cells maintains homeostatic copper balance, while hypoxic microenvironments hinder therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we present a nanozyme system, termed CussOMEp, comprising a copper-based nanovector (CussNV) that is PEGylated and loaded with omeprazole, a copper transporter inhibitor, to enhance tumor synergistic immunotherapy by promoting cuproptosis and ferroptosis. CussNV is assembled from dithiodiglycolic acid and copper ions, exhibiting peroxidase, glutathione oxidase, and catalase-like activities, along with responsive degradability. This nanozyme alleviates tumor hypoxia by producing oxygen, induces ferroptosis through the generation of lethal hydroxyl radicals, and depletes glutathione. Additionally, omeprazole increases cellular copper concentration and oxidative stress by inhibiting the intracellular copper-transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A), enhancing lipoylated protein oligomerization and cuproptosis. In a breast tumor mouse model, CussOMEp elicits robust antitumor immune responses, including dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation. When combined with PD-1 antibodies (αPD-1), CussOMEp significantly inhibits tumor metastasis in bilateral and lung metastatic models. This work presents a functional nanozyme system as a promising strategy for synergistic tumor immunotherapy leveraging ferroptosis and cuproptosis. ",Journal of nanobiotechnology,

The most common indication for pancreaticoduodenectomy is malignancy, but can include benign tumours and chronic pancreatitis. Complete surgical resection, with negative margins, provides the best prospect of long-term survival. Pancreaticoduodenectomy involves specific and unique alterations to the digestive system and maintaining nutritional status (optimising outcomes and achieving resumption of a normal diet) in patients with cancer after major surgery is a challenge. Malnutrition is a risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy, due to the magnitude of the operation and the frequency of complications. Postoperatively, patients are fed either orally, enterally or parenterally. Oral intake may start with fluids and then progress to solid food, or may be ad libitum. Enteral feeding may be via a nasojejunal tube or feeding tube jejunostomy. Parenteral nutrition can be delivered via a central or peripheral intravenous line, and may provide full nutrition (TPN) or partial nutrition (supplemental PN). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after pancreaticoduodenectomy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and CINAHL (from inception to October 2022), ongoing trials registers and other internet databases. We searched previous systematic reviews, relevant publications on the same topic and the references of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of postoperative nutritional interventions in an inpatient setting for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. We specifically looked for studies comparing route or timing rather than nutritional content. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, judged the risk of bias and extracted data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, risk of bias and data extraction by an external translator and another author. We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 studies (1897 participants). Of these, eight studies could be included in a meta-analysis. The route, timing and target of nutritional support varied widely between studies. Enteral feeding (jejunostomy, nasojejunal or gastrojejunostomy) was used in at least 13 studies (one study did not specify the method of enteral route), parenteral nutrition (PN) was used in at least 10 studies (two studies had a control of 'surgeon's preference' and no further details were given) and oral intake was used in seven studies. Overall, the evidence presented in this review is of low to very low certainty. Four studies compared jejunostomy feeding with total parenteral nutrition. When we pooled these four studies, the evidence demonstrated that jejunostomy likely results in a reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -1.61 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.31 to -0.92; 3 studies, 316 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggested that there may be no difference in postoperative pancreatic fistula (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.47; 4 studies, 346 participants; low-certainty evidence) and that there may be no difference in delayed gastric emptying (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.50; 2 studies, 270 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or post pancreatectomy haemorrhage (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.29; 2 studies, 270 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. There were no data for major and minor complications defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification. Two studies compared nasojejunal feeding with total parenteral nutrition. When the two studies were pooled, the evidence suggested that there may be little to no difference between nasojejunal feeding and TPN in the length of hospital stay (MD 1.07 days, 95% CI -2.64 to 4.79; 2 studies, 242 participants; low-certainty evidence), delayed gastric emptying (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.91; 2 studies, 242 participants; low-certainty evidence) or post pancreatectomy haemorrhage (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62; 2 studies, 242 participants; low-certainty evidence). TPN may slightly improve rates of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.74; 2 studies, 242 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported on major complications (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.94; very low-certainty evidence) and minor complications (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.50; 204 participants; very low-certainty evidence) defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification and there may be little to no difference in effect, but the evidence is uncertain. Two studies compared jejunostomy feeding with oral intake. Of note, one of the studies used a modified surgical technique as part of the intervention. We pooled these studies and found that there may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay (MD -1.99 days, 95% CI -4.90 to 0.91; 2 studies, 301 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or delayed gastric emptying (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.88; 2 studies, 307 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported on major complications (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.34; 247 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and minor complications (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.15; 247 participants; very low-certainty evidence) defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification, postoperative pancreatic fistula (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.50; 247 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and post pancreatectomy haemorrhage (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.52 to 7.88; 247 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in effect on these outcomes, but the evidence is uncertain. No difference in mortality was detected in any of the analyses (Clavien-Dindo Grade V) (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When compared with parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications. When compared with parenteral nutrition, enteral feeding by nasojejunal tube may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay. When compared with oral nutrition, enteral nutrition by jejunostomy feeding may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. Further high-quality research is required and there are several ongoing studies. Given the number of different nutritional interventions available in the postoperative setting, a network meta-analysis would be more appropriate in future.

TIMM23 (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23) is a core component of the mitochondrial import machinery, facilitating the translocation of proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix. Its expression and potential functions in NSCLC were tested. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis revealed a strong correlation between TIMM23 overexpression and adverse clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing data further corroborated these findings, demonstrating elevated TIMM23 expression within the cancer cells of NSCLC mass. Subsequent experimental validation confirmed significantly increased TIMM23 mRNA and protein levels in locally-treated NSCLC tissues compared to matched normal lung tissues. Moreover, TIMM23 expression was consistently elevated across multiple primary/established NSCLC cells. Silencing or ablation of TIMM23 via shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 in NSCLC cells resulted in impaired mitochondrial function, characterized by reduced complex I activity, ATP depletion, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation. These mitochondrial perturbations coincided with attenuated cell viability, proliferation, and migratory capacity, and concomitant induction of apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of TIMM23 significantly enhanced mitochondrial complex I activity and ATP production, promoting NSCLC cell proliferation and motility. In vivo, intratumoral delivery of a TIMM23 shRNA-expressing adeno-associated virus significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous NSCLC xenografts in nude mice. Subsequent analysis of tumor tissues revealed depleted TIMM23 expression, ATP reduction, oxidative damage, proliferative arrest, and apoptotic induction. Collectively, these findings establish TIMM23 as a critical pro-tumorigenic factor in NSCLC, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. ",Cell death & disease,

Few controlled studies have examined the extent to which ecologic measures of increases in opioid prescribing and overdose injuries reflect risk among patients prescribed opioids, let alone whether some opioid regimens are safer than others. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the risk of unintentional overdose injury is associated with the duration of opioid action (ie, long-acting vs short-acting formulations). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A propensity score-adjusted cohort study was conducted using population-based health care utilization data from the Veterans Administration Healthcare System. The patients were veterans with chronic painful conditions who began therapy with opioid analgesics between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Unintentional overdoses that are explicitly coded using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes as drug or medication poisonings of accidental intent (E850.x-860.x) or undetermined intent (E980.x or drug poisoning [960.x-980.x] without an accompanying external cause of injury code). RESULTS: A total of 319 unintentional overdose events were observed. Patients initiating therapy with long-acting opioids were more than twice as likely to overdose compared with persons initiating therapy with short-acting opioids. After adjustment for age, sex, opioid dose, and other clinical characteristics, patients receiving long-acting opioids had a significantly higher rate of overdose injury than did those receiving short-acting opioids (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33; 95% CI, 1.26-4.32). The risk associated with long-acting agents was particularly marked during the first 2 weeks after initiation of treatment (HR, 5.25; 1.88-14.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, the findings of the present study provide the first evidence that the risk of unintentional overdose injury is related to the prescribed opioid's duration of action. If replicated in other cohorts, our findings suggest that clinicians weighing the benefits and risks of initiating different opioid regimens should consider not only the daily dose prescribed but also the duration of opioid action, favoring short-acting agents whenever possible, especially during the first 2 weeks of therapy.

We then analyze the potential toxicities arising from medications for these conditions and those of mHSPC: ARPIs (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) and docetaxel. EXPERT OPINION: Before mHSPC patients are treated with an ARPI, careful assessment of patient eligibility for each treatment alternative and potential DDIs between these and treatments for current comorbidities is a fundamental component in clinical decision-making. ARPIs with low potential DDIs allow keeping current concomitant medications without significant relevant dose adjustments and help reduce the risk of toxicities and comorbidity-related decompensation.

The HFpEF syndrome is associated with a high comorbidity burden, including high prevalence of obesity and hypertension. Although inflammation is implicated to play a key role in HFpEF pathophysiology, underlying causal mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Comparing patient samples and animal models, we defined the innate immune response during HFpEF in situ and through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. After identifying transcriptional and cell signatures, we implemented a high-fat diet and hypertensive model of HFpEF and tested roles for myeloid and hematopoietic stem cells during HFpEF. Contributions of macrophage metabolism were also evaluated, including through mass spectrometry and carbon labeling. Primary macrophages were studied ex vivo to gain insight into complementary cell-intrinsic mechanisms. RESULTS: Here we report evidence that patients with cardiometabolic HFpEF exhibit elevated peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. This phenotype was conserved across species in a murine mode of high-fat diet and hypertension. Hematopoietic stem cell proliferation was coupled to striking remodeling of the peripheral hematopoietic stem cell niche and expression of the macrophage adhesion molecule Vcam1. This could be partially inhibited by sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and explained by elevated fatty acid metabolism in macrophage mitochondria, which in turn remodeled the Vcam1 promoter to enhance its expression.

This post hoc subgroup analysis of POLARIX evaluated the efficacy and safety of Pola-R-CHP versus R-CHOP in elderly patients ≥60, ≥65, ≥70, and ≥75 years. As of June 15, 2022 (median follow-up 40 months), 629 patients ≥60 years were included (Pola-R-CHP, n = 311; R-CHOP, n = 318). Clinically meaningful improvements in PFS with Pola-R-CHP versus R-CHOP were observed across all age groups, particularly in patients ≥70 years whereby the risk of disease progression, relapse or death was reduced by 37% (unstratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.96). In patients ≥ 60 years, overall survival was similar with Pola-R-CHP versus R-CHOP (unstratified HR 0. 99; 95% CI: 0.67 -1.47 ). Safety profiles were similar for Pola-R-CHP versus R-CHOP among patients ≥60 years, including rates of grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs; 62.7% vs 61.5%), grade 3-5 infections (15.0% vs 12.9%), and grade 5 AEs (3.6% vs 3.2%); no novel toxicities were reported. Incidence of grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia was higher with Pola-R-CHP than R-CHOP (16.3% vs 7.6%), highlighting the importance of G-CSF prophylaxis in elderly patients receiving Pola-R-CHP.

Understanding the influenza mortality burden in ICU settings can inform treatment planning and resource allocation. Nonetheless, surveillance data on mortality in ICU-admitted patients are scarce and estimates vary greatly. This systematic literature review (SLR) and meta-analysis investigated all-cause mortality risk among ICU-admitted patients with influenza in Europe. METHODS: We included observational studies conducted in Europe that reported mortality among patients ≥ 6 months of age with influenza admitted to the ICU. Studies published between January-2009 and December-2019 were included. Quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled all-cause mortality risk was calculated as a proportion using a random-effects model with an inverse variance method. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted, including only studies identified as having low risk of bias. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies, reporting on 13,616 patients, were included. All-cause mortality ranged from 0% to 67%. The overall pooled mortality risk estimate was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.27). Study heterogeneity was high (Cochran's Q test p < 0.01, I(2) = 93%). The sensitivity analysis using only studies identified as having low risk of bias produced a pooled mortality risk of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.21, 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that approximately a quarter of patients with influenza admitted to the ICU die, reinforcing the need for effective vaccination programs and treatment optimization.

Its significance in inflammatory arthritis is well-established, but its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms through which curcumin-mediated photodynamic therapy (CUR-PDT) triggers ferroptosis in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). METHODS: In vivo studies using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model evaluated CUR-PDT effects on joint edema, synovial inflammation, and fibrosis through paw volume measurements and H&E and Masson's trichrome staining. The expression of Nrf2, xCT, and GPX4 in FLSs was assessed via ELISA and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, MH7A cells treated with TNF-α were analyzed for viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration through various assays. Mitochondrial potential and morphology were examined using JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ferroptosis biomarkers, including ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and Fe(2+) levels, were measured. Nrf2, xCT, and GPX4 levels were quantified with RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was employed to knock down Nrf2 to validate the effect of CUR-PDT on ferroptosis in RA-FLS. RESULTS: The CUR-PDT therapy markedly reduced joint inflammation and collagen deposition in the synovial tissue of CIA rats. It effectively alleviated both inflammation and hyperplasia. Moreover, this therapy facilitated ferroptosis within the synovial tissue. In vitro analyses indicated that CUR-PDT diminished the proliferation and viability of FLSs, resulting in increased ROS levels in the cells. This cascade initiated ferroptosis, as evidenced by decreased glutathione, heightened iron concentrations, mitochondrial shrinkage, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Crucially, the expression of xCT and GPX4 was significantly lowered. Interestingly, knocking down the Nrf2 gene amplified this effect, leading to an even greater reduction in xCT and GPX4 expression. In this context, RA-FLSs exhibited more pronounced ferroptotic traits, including diminished proliferation, invasion, and migration. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated a mechanism by which CUR-PDT triggers ferroptosis in FLSs through the downregulation of the Nrf2-xCT-GPX4 signaling cascade, thereby effectively hindering the progression of RA and emphasizing the importance of targeting Nrf2 in disease advancement.

Increasing evidence points to metabolic dysfunction, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction, as a contributing factor to glaucomatous neurodegeneration. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify key metabolic pathways and biomarkers associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies measuring metabolites in plasma and aqueous humour from patients with POAG using metabolomics techniques. Enrichment analyses for significantly increased metabolites were conducted using MetaboAnalyst. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to calculate effect sizes for metabolites reported in at least three studies. RESULTS: 17 studies involving patients with POAG were included. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of the arginine and proline metabolism pathway in both aqueous humour and plasma. Additionally, the phenylalanine metabolism pathway was enriched in plasma. These pathways are associated with oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, both of which are key factors in POAG pathology. Meta-analysis identified several significantly elevated metabolites, including lysine, glutamine, alanine, histidine, carnitine and creatinine in aqueous humour, as well as methionine in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the central role of metabolic dysfunction in POAG, highlighting specific metabolites and pathways that could serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Future research should prioritise longitudinal studies and untargeted metabolomic profiling to further deepen our understanding of metabolic changes and their contributions to glaucoma progression.

Recently, mQTL and iQTL maps have proven useful in understanding relationships between SNPs and GWAS that are not captured by eQTL. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation. We construct a public placental cis-mQTL database including 214,830 CpG sites calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, and run cell type-, gestational age- and sex-imQTL models. We combine these data with summary statistics of GWAS on ten neuropsychiatric disorders using summary-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization. We also evaluate the influence of identified DNA methylation sites on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort. We find that placental cis-mQTLs are enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and establish that part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNA methylation. The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, the involvement of cell type-imQTLs, and the correlation of identified DNA methylation sites with the expression levels of relevant genes in the placenta.

","Capoccia, Danila, Milani, Ilaria, Colangeli, Luca, Parrotta, Maria Eugenia, Leonetti, Frida, Guglielmi, Valeria","AIMS: Obesity is a multifactorial disease influenced by several factors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition. In recent years, the social and environmental context, along with race/ethnicity and gender, have been recognized as factors influencing obesity risk beyond traditional risk factors. This review aims to increase knowledge of these causal determinants and their implications for the treatment and management of obesity, addressing not only the individual but also the societal sphere. DATA SYNTHESIS: A growing body of evidence emphasizes the interaction between the physical and social environments in shaping personal behaviors related to obesity. Social disparities, such as socioeconomic status (income, education, employment), racial/ethnic differences, and gender, contribute significantly to weight gain from childhood to adulthood. These factors increase the risk of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors, independent of clinical and demographic variables, and may lead to stigma and discrimination against those affected. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity prevention solutions, from community programs to national policies, may be more effective if they address social, gender, and ethnic barriers. Understanding obesity requires a comprehensive approach that includes social, environmental, and psychological factors, as well as biological causes, to help obesity experts develop more effective interventions tailored to obesity and related diseases.

However, many patients experience a suboptimal response. To optimally select the best therapy, predictive biomarkers are necessary. Here, we used the PI3K inhibitor umbralisib as a model to (i) understand how targeted treatment affects cell signaling and immunophenotypes in responders and non-responders; (ii) identify molecular features that predict individual treatment responses; and (iii) suggest alternative treatment options for the non-responders. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed functional phenotyping of CLL cells from patients enrolled in two clinical trials with umbralisib, administered either as a monotherapy (NCT02742090, n=55) or in combination with the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (NCT04624633, n=12). RESULTS: We found that umbralisib monotherapy led to significant changes in (phospho)protein levels, including AKT (pS473), in responders but not in non-responders. Furthermore, the proportion of cytotoxic natural killer cells increased at the end of study, but only in responders, suggesting a role in the anti-tumor response. To identify molecular predictors of response, we used the baseline levels of 30 (phospho)proteins in the monotherapy cohort as input features for a machine learning model, which achieved a significant prediction accuracy in cross-validation and maintained its predictive power in the combination cohort. Drug sensitivity profiling of the CLL cells at baseline suggested that PI3K + Bcl-2 inhibitors are effective in umbralisib non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: Functional phenotyping reveals differential cellular responses to umbralisib treatment in responders and non-responders; predicts treatment response of individual CLL patients; and suggests alternative treatment options for the non-responders.

"('LID', '10.1001/jama.2025.0228')",Prostate Cancer: A Review. ,"Raychaudhuri, Ruben, Lin, Daniel W, Montgomery, R Bruce","IMPORTANCE: Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in men in the US, with an estimated 299 010 new cases and 35 250 deaths in 2024. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, with 1 466 680 new cases and 396 792 deaths in 2022. OBSERVATIONS: The most common type of prostate cancer is adenocarcinoma (≥99%), and the median age at diagnosis is 67 years. More than 50% of prostate cancer risk is attributable to genetic factors; older age and Black race (annual incidence rate, 173.0 cases per 100 000 Black men vs 97.1 cases per 100 000 White men) are also strong risk factors. Recent guidelines encourage shared decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. At diagnosis, approximately 75% of patients have cancer localized to the prostate, which is associated with a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. Based on risk stratification that incorporates life expectancy, tumor grade (Gleason score), tumor size, and PSA level, one-third of patients with localized prostate cancer are appropriate for active surveillance with serial PSA measurements, prostate biopsies, or magnetic resonance imaging, and initiation of treatment if the Gleason score or tumor stage increases. For patients with higher-risk disease, radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy are reasonable options; treatment decision-making should include consideration of adverse events and comorbidities. Despite definitive therapy, 2% to 56% of men with localized disease develop distant metastases, depending on tumor risk factors. At presentation, approximately 14% of patients have metastases to regional lymph nodes. An additional 10% of men have distant metastases that are associated with a 5-year survival rate of 37%. Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer primarily relies on androgen deprivation therapy, most commonly through medical castration with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. For patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, the addition of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (eg, darolutamide, abiraterone) improves survival. Use of abiraterone improved the median overall survival from 36.5 months to 53.3 months (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.56-0.78]) compared with medical castration alone. Chemotherapy (docetaxel) may be considered, especially for patients with more extensive disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 1.5 million new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. Approximately 75% of patients present with cancer localized to the prostate, which is associated with a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. Management includes active surveillance, prostatectomy, or radiation therapy, depending on risk of progression. Approximately 10% of patients present with metastatic prostate cancer, which has a 5-year survival rate of 37%. First-line therapies for metastatic prostate cancer include androgen deprivation and novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, and chemotherapy for appropriate patients. ",JAMA,

However, the role of palmitoylation in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been systematically investigated. Additionally, findings on DNA methylation changes and PD-associated gene expression remain inconsistent. This study aims to explore the causal relationship and mechanisms between palmitoylation genes, DNA methylation, and PD using Mendelian Randomization (MR). This study employed two-sample MR analysis, summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis, and mediation analysis, utilizing PD GWAS data from the Finngen database, palmitoylation genes data from the eQTLGen database, and DNA methylation data from the GoDMC database. First, a two-sample MR analysis was used to evaluate the causal relationship between the palmitoylation genes and PD. Then, the SMR method was applied to validate the association between gene expression and PD. Finally, mediation analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effect of DNA methylation on the relationship between expression of palmitoylation genes and PD. Our study found a significant positive correlation between high expression of the ZDHHC13 gene and increased PD risk. Each 1 standard deviation increase in ZDHHC13 expression was associated with a 24.20% increase in PD risk. Further DNA methylation analysis identified two key methylation sites (cg00161556 and cg27379915), which indirectly influenced the occurrence of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene. Mediation effect analysis revealed that the methylation sites cg00161556 and cg27379915 indirectly promoted the development of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene, with the mediation effect of ZDHHC13 gene expression accounting for 63.72% and 57.61% of the total effect, respectively. Sensitivity analysis and SMR analysis supported our findings, indicating high statistical robustness. This study highlights the role of DNA methylation in regulating ZDHHC13 during PD progression, suggesting potential clinical applications such as ZDHHC13 as a biomarker or therapeutic target for early PD diagnosis and treatment.

This study found an elevated circRNA, circRUNX1, whiche promotes glycolysis and lactate generation, resulting in the infiltration of regulatory T cell (Treg) in NSCLC. circRUNX1 acts as a miR-145 sponge, inhibiting its negative regulation of the target gene HK2, therefore facilitating glycolysis and lactate generation. The accumulation of lactic acid in the tumor microenvironment promotes Treg cell proliferation and aids immune evasion.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with a total of 5157 adolescents in 5 primary schools, 8 junior high schools, and 2 senior high schools in Shandong province, China. Male and female adolescents' networks were assessed in all grades using the Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran (EMBU), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7). Network differences by gender and educational stages were further assessed stratified. Network analysis was used to identify central items and edges with important associations between depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and parenting styles. All analyses in this study were performed using the R program (version 4.3.2). RESULTS: Parenting styles can influence the overall depressive network by acting on PHQ9 (Suicidal thoughts) through EMBU1 (Punishment denial) and EMBU2 (Emotional warmth) in adolescents. Parenting styles had displayed gender-specific emotional impacts on adolescents. EMBU1 (Punishment denial) affected the anxiety network in senior high school male adolescents by increasing GAD6 (Easily annoyed/Irritable) and impacting their depression network by reducing the PHQ6 (Failure). However, none of these effects were found in senior high school female adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The mood disorder and anxiety in male students were susceptible to the influence of the manner of upbringing. Depressive and anxiety symptom-specific issues related to parenting styles may be important in the development and maintenance of mood disorders in adolescents.

In this work, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of DMTs from two trypanosomatid species, Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata, at resolutions up to 2.7 angstrom. The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior. Our study shows that proper B-tubule closure is critical for flagellar motility, exemplifying how integrating structural identification with systematic gene deletion can dissect individual protein contributions to flagellar motility.

As previously shown, the STOP model, a machine learning model based on serum tumor markers, is capable of identifying non-responders after 6 weeks of ICIs.ObjectiveThis study aims to externally validate this model and to assess the predictive value in combination with radiological response assessment using RECIST criteria.MethodsIn a cohort of 242 metastatic NSCLC patients, CYFRA, CEA, and NSE were measured before start and after 6 weeks of ICI treatment. The ability of the STOP model to predict no durable benefit (NDB; progressive disease, death within 6 months or disease control of less than 6 months) was assessed using specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Moreover, a combination of the STOP model with RECIST after 6-8 weeks of ICIs was investigated.ResultsThe STOP model achieved a specificity of 96% (95% CI 95%-97%) and a PPV of predicting NDB of 88.1% (95% CI 85.9%-90.3%). Combining the STOP model with RECIST improved specificity and PPV to 100% and predicted NDB on average 11.6 weeks (IQR 1.8-18.0 weeks) prior to developing radiologically defined progression.ConclusionsAfter 6 weeks of ICIs, the blood-based STOP model was capable of accurately predicting NDB in metastatic NSCLC patients, earlier than conventional radiological assessment. The combined serological and radiological response assessment creates an early opportunity to safely stop ICI treatment in patients who will not benefit, although the clinical utility of the assay is limited since the high specificity comes at the cost of a lower sensitivity.

However, little is known about the impacts of air pollutants on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. We aimed to explore the association of long-term exposure to air pollutants with BPH among men. METHODS: We leveraged the nationally representative data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a total of 8,826 participants aged 45 years and above from 125 Chinese cities were enrolled in 2015. Annual fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), coarse particles (PM(2.5-10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone were estimated using satellite-based models. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the risk of BPH associated with air pollutants. The restricted cubic spline model was performed to explore the exposure-response relationships with BPH. RESULTS: Of the 8,826 participants (mean age: 60.3 years), the prevalence of BPH was 14.5%. Each 10 µg/m(3) rise in PM(2.5) (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence intervals: 1.01-1.07) and PM(2.5-10) (1.06, 1.02-1.10) were associated with prevalent BPH. Compared with the lowest quartile levels, higher PM(2.5) and PM(2.5-10) exposure were related to an increased risk of BPH. There were non-linear relationship between PM(2.5-10) and NO(2) exposure with prevalent BPH. The association with BPH was more pronounced in participants who were overweight/obesity. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that long-term air pollutants exposure, especially for PM(2.5) and PM(2.5-10), is associated with BPH among middle-aged and older men. Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for policymakers and researchers to improve prostate health by reducing air pollution.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the role of GPR171 in modulating CD4(+) T cell effector functions in IBD and evaluate its therapeutic potential. DESIGN: We analysed GPR171 expression in colon biopsies and peripheral blood samples from patients with IBD and assessed the impact of GPR171 on CD4(+) T cell differentiation through administration of its endogenous ligand (BigLEN). We further determined the role of GPR171 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and CD45RB(high)CD4(+) T-cell transfer colitis model and deciphered the underlying mechanisms using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and lipidomics. We developed a novel BigLEN-based Fc fusion protein (BigLEN-Fc) and evaluated its potential in preventing and treating colitis. RESULTS: GPR171 was markedly increased in inflamed mucosa and CD4(+) T cells of patients with IBD compared with controls. BigLEN-triggered GPR171 activation inhibited Th17 cell differentiation in vitro. GPR171 deficiency exacerbated DSS- and CD45RB(high)CD4(+) T cell-induced colitis in mice, characterised by increased Th17 cell responses in intestinal mucosa. Mechanistically, GPR171 deficiency promoted Th17 cell differentiation and altered lipidome profile in Th17 cells via the cAMP-pCREB-FABP5 axis. Blockage of FABP5 reduced Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in Gpr171 (-/-) mice. Furthermore, BigLEN-mutFc administration potently mitigated colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: GPR171 deficiency promotes Th17 cell differentiation and causes lipid metabolism perturbation, contributing to intestinal inflammation in a FABP5-dependent manner.

METHODS: Data of this study were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018. We performed cross-sectional analyses using multinomial logistic regression to investigate the relationship between OBS and CKM staging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of OBS on mortality outcomes in CKM patients. Additionally, mediation analyses were performed to explore whether OBS mediated the relationships between specific predictors (Life's Simple 7 score [LS7], systemic immune-inflammation index [SII], frailty score) and mortality outcomes. Then, machine learning models were developed to classify CKM stages 3/4 and predict all-cause mortality, with SHapley Additive exPlanations values used to interpret the contribution of OBS components.

In Europe, IFIs are primarily associated with transplantation, intensive care, and chronic diseases. Inspired by initiatives in the Caribbean and Latin America in 2019, efforts to map global diagnostic and treatment resources expanded to Africa, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. This study conducts a comparative analysis, mainly drawing data from Brazil and Europe, to investigate IFI epidemiology and management. Data were collected through online surveys distributed to Brazilian and European institutions, with collaborations from scientific organizations. Surveys covered institutional profiles, IFI diagnoses, accessibility to diagnostic techniques, and antifungal drugs. A comparative survey involving 96 Brazilian and 388 European institutions revealed variations in the perception and practices related to fungal pathogens. Differences in ranking and prevalence were observed, along with variations in diagnostic procedures, fluorescence dye usage, culture practices, antifungal medication availability, and technological approaches. Europe exhibited higher utilization rates for molecular diagnostic approaches, including PCR tests, and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was more widespread in Europe compared with Brazil, indicating substantial differences in understanding and managing fungal infections. Customized IFI management is crucial, considering regional differences and addressing technological gaps like underutilized PCR. The study advocates for increased international collaboration, targeted training, and enhanced resources to foster a unified global approach in preventing, diagnosing, and treating IFI. IMPORTANCE: This work is significant as it highlights the unique challenges Brazil faces in managing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to its diverse ecosystems and public health landscape. By comparing Brazil's situation with Europe-where IFIs are mainly linked to transplantation and intensive care-this study identifies key disparities in diagnostic and treatment practices. The findings reveal substantial differences in the availability and use of molecular diagnostics, antifungal drugs, and therapeutic drug monitoring, with Europe demonstrating more advanced practices. By mapping these variations, the study underscores the importance of tailored approaches to IFI management that consider regional differences and technological gaps.

Combining CD47 modification with antibodies targeting endothelial cells, T cells, or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) increased targeting efficiency up to 3-fold compared to tLNP alone. Enhanced targeting of CD47/tLNP to HSCs with reduced off-targeting enabled the delivery of pro-apoptotic mRNA for HSC depletion as a preconditioning strategy prior to bone marrow transplant. Additionally, CD47-modified LNPs showed diminished inflammatory effects on hepatic tissue and an altered protein corona.

Long-term exposure to PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), CO, and O(3) was assessed using geocoded residential addresses linked to air quality data. Cox proportional hazards models and subgroup interaction analyses were used to evaluate associations between pollutants and GI disease incidence, adjusting for demographic and behavioral confounders. RESULTS: The incidence of GI disease was 21.4% among participants. Long-term exposure to PM(2.5) (HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.33-1.44), PM(10) (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.26-1.36), SO(2) (HR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.68-1.81), NO(2) (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.17-1.25), CO (HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.42-1.54), and O(3) (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.59) was significantly associated with GI disease. Interaction analyses showed that the effects of pollutants varied by region, residence, smoking, and alcohol use. Urban residents and those living in specific regions experienced stronger associations, likely due to higher pollution levels and different environmental factors. Smokers and alcohol users were also more susceptible to the adverse effects of pollutants.

PURPOSE: To investigate the use of mitochondria isolated from bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Mito) for mitigating complications after RCT, focusing on muscle protection. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: RCTs were induced by transecting the tendons of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus in Sprague-Dawley rats. In vivo, 90 rats were randomized into 3 groups: sham (no intervention), RCTs treated with BMSC-Mito, and RCTs treated with phosphate-buffered saline. After 6 weeks of intramuscular injections of BMSC-Mito or phosphate-buffered saline, supraspinatus muscles were harvested for analysis. Evaluations included wet muscle weight, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, fibrosis, fatty infiltration, slow-fast myofiber types and muscle biomechanics, capillary density, mitochondria respiratory chain complex activity, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. In vitro experiments utilized primary rat skeletal muscle cells pretreated with rhodamine 6G to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, assessing the effects of BMSC-Mito on cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxidative stress levels. RESULTS: BMSC-Mito can be effectively transplanted into muscles and integrated into the local mitochondrial network. After RCT, the supraspinatus showed significant mass loss, reduced fiber cross-sectional area, fatty infiltration, and a shift from slow to fast myofiber types, which negatively affected muscle biomechanics. These changes were reversed by BMSC-Mito. BMSC-Mito also preserved vascularity (CD31 and α-SMA) impaired by RCT. Additionally, BMSC-Mito notably improved disuse-induced mitochondrial changes, leading to increased mitochondrial number and COX IV expression; furthermore, BMSC-Mito protected mitochondria morphology and enhanced cytosolic superoxide dismutase activity. This treatment also improved mitochondria respiratory chain complex activity and ATP concentration, reducing oxidative stress. In vitro, BMSC-Mito treatment effectively maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells, improved cell viability, and restored its mitochondrial function and ATP levels. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BMSC-Mito might play a role in preventing muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration after RCT through the protection of mitochondrial function and the promotion of angiogenesis.

A multidisciplinary panel conducted a systematic review and developed practice recommendations following the process outlined in the 2017 edition of the American Academy of Neurology Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual. The systematic review includes studies through August 2022. Recommendations are supported by structured rationales that integrate evidence from the systematic review, related evidence, principles of care, and inferences from evidence. The following are some of the major recommendations. When treating PWECP, clinicians should recommend ASMs and doses that optimize both seizure control and fetal outcomes should pregnancy occur, at the earliest possible opportunity preconceptionally. Clinicians must minimize the occurrence of convulsive seizures in PWECP during pregnancy to minimize potential risks to the birth parent and to the fetus. Once a PWECP is already pregnant, clinicians should exercise caution in attempting to remove or replace an ASM that is effective in controlling generalized tonic-clonic or focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Clinicians must consider using lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or oxcarbazepine in PWECP when appropriate based on the patient's epilepsy syndrome, likelihood of achieving seizure control, and comorbidities, to minimize the risk of MCMs. Clinicians must avoid the use of valproic acid in PWECP to minimize the risk of MCMs or neural tube defects (NTDs), if clinically feasible. Clinicians should avoid the use of valproic acid or topiramate in PWECP to minimize the risk of offspring being born small for gestational age, if clinically feasible. To reduce the risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autism spectrum disorder and lower IQ, in children born to PWECP, clinicians must avoid the use of valproic acid in PWECP, if clinically feasible. Clinicians should prescribe at least 0.4 mg of folic acid supplementation daily preconceptionally and during pregnancy to any PWECP treated with an ASM to decrease the risk of NTDs and possibly improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring.

It prevents postoperative stiffness, fatty infiltration, muscle atrophy and loss of range of motion. Usually, use of a brace fixation that immobilizes the shoulder in 30° of abduction during the postoperative rehabilitation period reduces tension on the repaired tendon, which improves tendon-bone healing. To investigate the effect of early exercise and brace fixation on postoperative recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by systematic review, thereby providing evidence-based evidence for clinical practice. METHODS: Chinese and English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang database, and VIP database) were searched by keywords until November 15, 2024. Randomized controlled studies comparing early exercise versus brace fixation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery were included, along with an evaluation of such studies using the Cochrane Collaboration risk assessment tool. Afterward, the effect of the intervention on the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, function, shoulder range of motion (forward flexion, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation), and postoperative complications (stiffness, re-tear) was evaluated based on a fixed or random effects model.

Pathological vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic transformation is the underlying cause of AAA. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether the RNA binding protein SAMD4A suppresses VSMC phenotype transformation and inhibits AAA formation. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted to reveal smooth muscle cell phenotypic heterogeneity and RNA-binding protein dysregulation during AAA formation. A pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced mouse AAA model was generated to confirm the function of SAMD4A in vivo. RNA-seq combined with RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR was used for mechanistic exploration. RESULTS: We identified 3 smooth muscle cell subtypes, and demonstrated their transformation from contractile to inflammatory-like VSMCs during AAA formation. SAMD4A expression was increased in contractile VSMCs and significantly reduced in AAAs. The results of functional experiments revealed that VSMC-specific knockout of SAMD4A exacerbated PPE-induced AAA formation, whereas VSMC knock-in attenuated AAA formation. SAMD4A regulated VSMC contraction by binding to KDM2B. Further in vivo studies revealed that overexpression of KDM2B abolished the protective effect of SAMD4A in AAA. ChIP-qPCR demonstrated that KDM2B suppressed the transcription of VSMC contractile markers by binding to their promoters and reducing H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: SAMD4A inhibits AAA development and VSMC phenotypic transformation by targeting KDM2B. This work highlights the potential of SAMD4A as a new therapeutic option to prevent AAA formation.

Both the entorhinal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex exhibit a 6-fold (or 'hexadirectional') modulation of neural activity during virtual navigation that is indicative of grid cell populations and associated with accurate spatial navigation. Here, we examined whether these grid-like patterns are disrupted in schizophrenia. We asked 17 participants with diagnoses of schizophrenia and 23 controls (matched for age, sex and IQ) to perform a virtual reality spatial navigation task during magnetoencephalography. The control group showed stronger 4-10 Hz theta power during movement onset, as well as hexadirectional modulation of theta band oscillatory activity in the right entorhinal cortex whose directional stability across trials correlated with navigational accuracy. This hexadirectional modulation was absent in schizophrenia patients, with a significant difference between groups. These results suggest that impairments in spatial and relational cognition associated with schizophrenia may arise from disrupted grid firing patterns in entorhinal cortex.

Tralokinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin-13, is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Recent real-world studies have observed the effectiveness of tralokinumab for H&N AD. Here, data from phase III parent trials, ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, and the long-term extension trial, ECZTEND, were used to assess impacts of long-term tralokinumab treatment on H&N AD and the association between improvements in H&N AD and patient quality of life, and to evaluate whether a proportion of patients developed paradoxical H&N erythema. METHODS: These post hoc analyses included data from all patients initiated on tralokinumab in ECZTRA 1 or ECZTRA 2. Patients were treated up to 4 years (i.e., up to 52 weeks in ECZTRA 1 or ECZTRA 2 plus up to 152 weeks in ECZTEND). Outcomes included body region subscores of the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI; H&N, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Correlations between H&N EASI and DLQI were assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ). The incidence of paradoxical H&N erythema (defined as H&N EASI erythema increasing from baseline to a score of 3, while all other regional EASI subscores are 0 or 1, during two or more consecutive visits) was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 1192 patients who were initiated on tralokinumab in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, of whom 523 patients opted to continue in ECZTEND, were analyzed. Percentages of patients who had H&N EASI ≤ 1 increased from 12.2% at parent trial baseline to 87.2% by week 152 of ECZTEND. Improvements in EASI subscore outcomes from parent trial baseline were comparable across body regions throughout all timepoints of the study. At parent trial week 16, H&N EASI was moderately correlated with total DLQI (ρ = 0.47), with the strongest numerical correlations observed for DLQI questions regarding skin discomfort (ρ = 0.43) and embarrassment due to skin (ρ = 0.40). During up to 4 years of treatment, seven tralokinumab-treated patients exhibited paradoxical H&N erythema, five of whom improved to absent or mild H&N EASI erythema with continued tralokinumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tralokinumab provided progressive and sustained improvements in H&N AD, with H&N EASI 0/1 observed in nearly 90% of patients treated up to 4 years. Improvements in H&N EASI were similar to improvements observed for other body regions and were associated with improvements in patient quality of life, particularly for skin discomfort and self-consciousness/embarrassment due to skin.

Exome-seq data revealed predominant alterations of keratinization-TP53 regulation and O-glycosylation-TP53 regulation axes in squamous and adeno-LACC, respectively, compared to in early-stage cervical cancer. Integrated clustering of mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation data identified six subtypes (Sub1-6) of LACC among which Sub3, 5, and 6 showed the treatment-resistant nature with poor local recurrence-free survival. Elevated immune and extracellular matrix (ECM) activation mediated by activated stroma (PDGFD and CXCL1(high) fibroblasts) characterized the immune-hot Sub3 enriched with MUC5AC(high) epithelial cells (ECs). Increased epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and ECM remodeling characterized the immune-cold squamous Sub5 enriched with PGK1 and CXCL10(high) ECs. We further demonstrated that CIC mutations could trigger EMT activation by upregulating ETV4, and the elevation of the immune checkpoint PVR and neutrophil-like myeloid-derived suppressive cells (FCN1 and FCGR3B(high) macrophages) could cause suppression of T-cell activation in Sub5. Increased O-linked glycosylation of mucin characterized adeno-LACC Sub6 enriched with MUC5AC(high) ECs.

The potential targets of triclosan were identified using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, SwissTargetPrediction, and TargetNet. PMOP-related targets were obtained from GeneCards, DisGeNET, and DrugBank. A total of 478 overlapping genes between disease targets and triclosan effectors were identified. Subsequent analysis using STRING and Cytoscape, applying the Matthews correlation coefficient algorithm, identified five core genes: STAT3, TP53, EGFR, MYC, and JUN. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses performed using R revealed that triclosan-induced PMOP is primarily associated with disrupted endocrine signaling and activation of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Molecular docking using CB-Dock2 confirmed strong binding affinities between triclosan and the core targets. Collectively, these results indicate that triclosan adversely affects bone health by disrupting endocrine regulation and energy metabolism through the PI3K-Akt pathway. This study establishes a theoretical framework for understanding how long-term triclosan exposure induces or exacerbates PMOP by investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms.

The genetic correlations and causality were examined by linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and meta-analysis. Potential shared genes were identified using MAGMA and PLACO. Finally, pathway enrichment using FUMA and Metascape, and scRNA-seq analysis were performed to determine biological mechanisms and gene expression atlas across various cell types in brain tissue. RESULTS: LDSC revealed that 50 brain IDPs were genetically correlated with PD (P < 0.05), in which 5 IDPs, exhibited putative causality on PD through MR (P < 0.05).

One of the important facets of body image is body appreciation, which consists of positive feelings and attitudes towards the body regardless of its perceived ""flaws"". To measure body appreciation, Body Appreciation Scale-2 (Tylka and Wood-Barcalow in Body Image 12:53-67, 2015a), a unidimensional 10-item measure, has been developed and routinely used in body image research. The current study examined the validity (i.e., factor structure, gender and age invariance, associations with other constructs) of the Czech version of Body Appreciation Scale-2 for adolescents. METHODS: The study used two large samples of Czech adolescents, aged 13-18 (N(1) = 613, M = 15.5, 52% girls; N(2) = 1,530, M = 15.4, 50% girls). The data were collected in August 2021 (N(1)) and November 2020 (N(2)) through an online survey. For the data analysis, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). RESULTS: Our findings supported the proposed unidimensional factor structure and the gender (i.e., girls, boys) and age (i.e., 13-15, 16-18) scalar invariance of the Czech version of Body Appreciation Scale-2. The data also showed the expected positive correlations with body satisfaction and self-esteem, and negative correlations with media-ideal internalization, appearance schematicity, and depression. Furthermore, we discovered that body appreciation was more strongly connected to media-ideal internalization and depression for girls than boys. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided robust evidence that supports the validity of the Czech version of Body Appreciation Scale-2 and its usability for the assessment of body appreciation in Czech adolescents. We also proposed future directions for the research on body appreciation based on the explored gender differences. ",Journal of eating disorders,

This study investigated the effects of melatonin, a natural hormone, on the migration of cancer cells in two cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in their respective media. The effective dose of melatonin in each cell line was determined using the MTT assay. The effects of IC50 melatonin on cell migration were assessed using the wound-healing assay. The expression of the invasion-related genes (MMP2 and MMP9), as well as the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, was analyzed using Real-Time RT-PCR. The wound-healing assay results indicated that 48 h of melatonin treatment at doses of 2.5 and 3.5 M significantly reduced migration in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, melatonin treatment decreased the invasion-related markers of both cell lines. Melatonin also increased the expression of MT1 and MT2 receptors in both cell lines, and the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was significantly reduced by melatonin (p < 0.05).

This evolutionary process has been particularly vivid in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), as this cancer and associated precursor lesions, including Barrett's esophagus (BE), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), co-exist in an accessible, two-dimensional pattern in esophageal mucosa. Given the durability of these precursor lesions, it is likely that they, like EAC, rely on stem cells for their regenerative growth. To assess the role of stem cells in the evolution of EAC, we apply technology that selectively clones stem cells from the gastrointestinal tract to patient-matched endoscopic biopsies from each of the precursor lesions implicated in EAC. METHODS: Histologically validated, endoscopic biopsy series including EAC, HGD, LGD, BE, and normal esophageal mucosa were obtained from patients presenting with EAC. Rare (1:1,000) cells from each of these lesions proved clonogenic and were assessed by in vitro differentiation, tumorigenicity in mice, and by molecular genetics. RESULTS: Each of the lesions in the evolution of EAC possess a discrete set of clonogenic cells marked by immaturity, enormous proliferative potential, and lesion-specific differentiation fate. DNA sequencing of these clones reveal intralesional heterogeneity and clonal resolution of the mutation progression within a given patient from BE, LGD, HGD, and EAC. High-throughput chemical screens against BE stem cells reveal drug combinations that are similarly effective against stem cells of LDG, HGD, and EAC.

However, unlocking its power requires a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria both evade antimicrobial immune defenses and stimulate anti-tumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Specifically, the hysteretic nonlinearity of interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) expression drives tumor-infiltrated immune cells into a tumor-specific IL-10R(hi) state. Bacteria leverage this to enhance tumor-associated macrophages producing IL-10, evade phagocytosis by tumor-associated neutrophils, and coincidently expand and stimulate the preexisting exhausted tumor-resident CD8(+) T cells. This effective combination eliminates tumors, prevents recurrence, and inhibits metastasis across multiple tumor types.

Initially identified on histones, lysine lactylation has been also described on non-histone proteins, playing a pivotal role in transcriptional activation, protein function, and cellular processes. Two major sources of the lactyl moiety have been currently distinguished: L-lactyl-CoA (precursor of the L-lactyl moiety) and S-D-lactylglutathione (precursor of the D-lactyl moiety), which enable enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms of lysine lactylation, respectively. Although the specific writers, erasers, and readers of this modification are still unclear, acetyltransferases and deacetylases have been proposed as crucial mediators of lysine lactylation. Remarkably, lactylation exerts significant influence on critical cancer-related pathways, thereby shaping cellular behavior during malignant transformation and the metastatic cascade. Hence, as recent insights into lysine lactylation underscore its growing potential in tumor biology, targeting this modification is emerging as a significant opportunity for cancer treatment.

Eligible patients received cemiplimab (250 mg on days 1 and 15) and isatuximab (10 mg/kg on days 2 and 16) intravenously every four weeks for six cycles. Responders then received cemiplimab (350 mg) and isatuximab (10 mg/kg) every three weeks for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate based on the best response. Out of 37 patients enrolled, the CR rate was 51% (19/37), exceeding the primary endpoint of 40%, and the objective response rate was 65% (24/37). After a median follow-up of 30.2 months (95% CI: 25.6-34.8 months), the median progression-free survival was 9.5 months (95% CI: 1.4-17.6 months), while the median overall survival had not yet been reached.

Hydroxyurea is a first-line drug therapy that switches sickle-globin to non-pathogenic γ-globin; however, it requires lifelong oral administration. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation allows for a one-time cure for SCD, albeit with histocompatibility limitations. Therefore, autologous HSC gene therapy was developed to cure SCD in a single treatment, without HSC donors. Current HSC gene therapy is based on the ex vivo culture of patients' HSCs with lentiviral gene addition and gene editing, followed by autologous transplantation back to the patient. However, the complexity of the treatment process and high costs hinder the universal application of ex vivo gene therapy. Therefore, the development of in vivo HSC gene therapy, where gene therapy tools are directly administered to patients, is desirable to provide a more accessible, cost-effective solution that can cure SCD worldwide. In this review, we discuss current treatments including drug therapies, HSC transplantation, and ex vivo gene therapy, the development of gene therapy tools, and progress toward curative in vivo gene therapy in SCD.

The Blood Urea Nitrogen to Creatinine Ratio(BUCR) is commonly utilized as a tool for evaluating renal function, particularly in cases where there are concerns about pre-renal or renal causes of azotemia. However, the connection between OSA and BUCR is not yet fully understood. METHODS: This study examined the link between BUCR and OSA in adults over 20 using National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys(NHANES) data from 2005-2008. Logistic regression models adjusted for multiple variables were used to analyze the relationship. The non-direct correspondence relationship were explored with a smooth curve and a two-part linear regression model, which revealed a threshold effect. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess variations among different populations. RESULTS: The survey, encompassing a total of 8826 participants, revealed that the median age of all respondents was 48 years, with a notable OSA prevalence of 51.3%. Upon adjusting for pertinent covariates using Model III(age, sex, marital status, education level, BMI, smoking status, drinking, hypertension, and diabetes), our findings indicated a significant association between OSA and BUCR, as evidenced by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00-1.02, P = 0.005). Furthermore, the risk association was found to be non-linear, featuring an inflection point for BUNR at 10.86. This non-linear relationship adds complexity to our understanding of the interplay between OSA and BUCR. In addition, a subgroup analysis underscored the influence of diabetes on the association between BUCR and OSA. CONCLUSION: This study reveals a significant correlation between elevated BUCR levels and the incidence of OSA, particularly in the presence of diabetes. This discovery underscores the necessity for additional research to investigate the underlying mechanisms and ramifications of this connection within the diabetic context. ",BMC pulmonary medicine,

Acoramidis is a selective, oral transthyretin stabilizer recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ATTR-CM. In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study (ATTRibute-CM [Efficacy and Safety of AG10 in Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy]), acoramidis was well tolerated and showed clinical efficacy in improving the primary endpoint, a hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular-related hospitalization (CVH), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and 6-minute walk distance. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to characterize the efficacy of acoramidis on ACM and CVH. METHODS: In ATTRibute-CM, participants with ATTR-CM were randomized 2:1 to receive acoramidis hydrochloride (800 mg twice daily) or placebo for 30 months. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intention-to-treat population (participants with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). CVH and the composite of ACM or first CVH were plotted by using Kaplan-Meier curves and summarized with a stratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Disruption of IFN-I signaling worsened alveolar bone resorption in a ligature-induced periodontitis murine model. Deficiency of the IFN-I pathway resulted in a more exaggerated inflammatory response in myeloid cells and drastically increased the interleukin-17 (IL-17)-mediated neutrophil recruitment in the gingiva. We further identified that the myeloid lineage-specific IFN-I response was essential in safeguarding against periodontal inflammation by suppressing the IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the gingiva. IFN-I signaling also directly repressed osteoclastogenesis in monocytes, which are precursor cells for osteoclasts. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that an integral myeloid-specific IFN-I pathway plays a protective role against bone loss by keeping the IL-17-neutrophil axis in check and directly inhibiting osteoclast formation in periodontitis.

Despite their conserved role, HC-Pros share approximately 40% similarity, implying potential differences in VSR efficiency, particularly in their ability to inhibit HEN1 methyltransferase activity. This study investigated the inhibitory potential of HC-Pros from different potyviruses in transgenic plants. P1/HC-Pro from turnip mosaic virus (P1/HC-Pro(Tu)) exhibited the most potent inhibition of HEN1, followed by P1/HC-Pro from zucchini yellow mosaic virus (P1/HC-Pro(Zy)), while P1/HC-Pro from tobacco etch virus (P1/HC-Pro(Te)) showed the weakest inhibitory effect. These differential effectual effects corresponded to variations in unmethylated microRNAs (unMet-miRNAs) accumulation across the transgenic lines. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis indicated that HC-Pro(Tu) recruits HEN1 and ATG8a to HC-Pro bodies (H-bodies) and indirectly associates with AGO1, potentially influencing the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and leading to the accumulation of free-form miRNA duplexes. The ability of HC-Pro(Tu) to sequester HEN1 and AGO1 in H-bodies may, therefore, modulate miRNA loading. This observation aligns with the finding that P1/HC-Pro(Tu) plants harbored approximately 50% unMet-miRNAs and exhibited the lowest AGO1 levels, suggesting a positive correlation between HEN1 inhibition and autophagic degradation of AGO1. Interestingly, unMet-miRNAs are absent in the AGO1 of P1/HC-Pro(Tu) plants but reappeared in P1/HC-Pro(Tu)/hen1-8/heso1-1 plants, accompanied by signs of AGO1 recovery. These findings highlight the functional diversity of HC-Pro VSRs and provide new insights into their differential effects on miRNA methylation, RISC assembly, and the regulation of RNA silencing pathways.

Increasing evidence shows that obesity contributes to IVDD, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we firstly revealed a causal correlation between obesity and IVDD via a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis and identified fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) as the potential regulator to associate IVDD and obesity. Elevated FABP4 expression promoted extracellular matrix (ECM) disequilibrium and angiogenesis to exacerbate IVDD progression. Genetically knocking out or pharmacologically inhibiting FABP4 in high-fat diet-induced mice alleviated IVDD. Mechanistically, obesity activated the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which upregulated FABP4 expression, leading to the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in intervertebral disc tissue. AGEs further activated the NF-κB signalling pathway, exacerbating ECM degradation and neovascularization. Conversely, rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 suppressed FABP4 expression in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), alleviating IVDD in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a critical role of the obesity-induced mTORC1-FABP4 axis in ECM degradation and angiogenesis during IVDD progression.

We aimed to explore whether a novel HSP90 inhibitor, C210, overcomes doxorubicin (DOX) resistance of quiescent breast cancer cells by targeting TRAP1. METHODS: Breast cancer cells were induced to quiescence by hypoxia and low glucose. The relationship of cell metabolism with HSP90 and TRAP1 was investigated by Western blotting, ECAR, OCR, mitochondrial complex activity, and proteomic analysis. The targets of C210 and their functions were analyzed by SPR and immunoprecipitation. The antitumor effect in vivo was investigated with mouse tumor model. RESULTS: In hypoxia and glucose deprivation, breast cancer cells exhibited elevated TRAP1 and an OXPHOS-enhanced quiescent phenotype. These cells were highly resistant to DOX but more sensitive to C210. C210 disrupted TRAP1's interaction with OXPHOS-associated client proteins, prompting proteasome-dependent degradation of these proteins, thereby reducing OCR, mitochondrial ATP production and resulting in selective elimination of the quiescent cancer cells by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis which could be reversed by exogenous ATP. Moreover, C210 targeted glycolytic, amino acid, and β-oxidation-associated proteome. C210 demonstrated promising in vivo anticancer efficacy which was particularly related to OXPHOS inhibition.

METHODS: We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses to identify schizophrenia risk genes in the 16p11.2 GWAS locus. We constructed a murine model with dysregulated expression of risk gene in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV), followed by behavioural assessments, dendritic spine analyses and RNA sequencing. FINDINGS: We identified significant associations between elevated INO80E mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and risk of schizophrenia. The mice overexpressing Ino80e in mPFC (Ino80e-OE) exhibited schizophrenia-like behaviours, including increased anxiety behaviour, anhedonia, and impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI) when compared with control group.

From 1982-1985 I was a Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Postdoctoral fellow in the Professor Alexander Rich laboratory, where I investigated structures of Z-DNA by NMR. At UCLA, my lab pioneered the application of macromolecular NMR spectroscopy to the study of DNA and RNA structure, folding, and interactions with cations, drugs, and proteins. We published the first NMR structures of DNA triplexes, quadruplexes, and aptamers, and our work has provided fundamental insights into DNA A-tract bending, cation interactions with DNA, Hoogsteen base pairs, and drug binding to DNA. My lab has made major contributions to understanding RNA folding, dynamics, and function, including pseudoknots, aptamers, ribozymes, and riboswitches, and recognition of RNA by proteins. Over the past 2 decades, the Feigon laboratory pioneered structure-function studies of telomerase, from solution NMR and X-ray crystal structures and dynamics studies of RNA and RNA-protein domains of human and Tetrahymena telomerase, to the first structure of a telomerase holoenzyme, by negative stain EM in 2013, and subsequent cryo-EM structures of telomerase and associated proteins.

Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and tau species have been detected in peripheral tissues and biological fluids of DLB patients and among different biological fluids, saliva represent an easely accessible and non-invasive source for biomarker detection.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate salivary a-syn and tau species as molecular disease biomarkers, assessing their potential in the diagnosis of DLB and in the differential diagnosis on respect to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).MethodsWe measured total and oligomeric a-syn, total-tau, and S199-phosphorylated-tau (pS199-tau) in the saliva of 21 DLB, 20 AD, 20 PD patients, and 20 healthy subjects (HS) using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses.ResultsSalivary total a-syn was not significantly changed between the different groups, whereas all pathological groups had a higher oligomeric a-syn concentration than HS. Salivary total-tau concentration was higher in all the pathological groups than HS, whereas the concentrations did not differ among patients' groups. Conversely, salivary levels of pS199-tau was higher in DLB and AD patients than in HS and PD patients. Both correlation matrix and principal component analysis showed that core clinical DLB features were related to a-syn pathology, while cognitive decline was associated with salivary levels of pS199-tau in both DLB and AD patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis reported high diagnostic accuracy for both a-syn oligomers and pS199-tau, between DLB and HS, and an adequate accuracy between DLB and PD. Conversely, the diagnostic accuracy was not optimal between DLB patients and AD patients.ConclusionsThese findings provide preliminary evidence that salivary a-syn and tau species might be promising in identifying DLB patients on respect to PD patients and HS, while the diagnostic potential is limited on respect to AD.

The optimal intensity and type (e.g., interval or continuous) of exercise training remains to be determined. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the optimal intensities and types of lower limb aerobic exercise in patients with COPD. DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant data. The interventions were classified according to their intensity and type as high-intensity interval training (HIIT), high-intensity continuous training (HICT), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), and low-intensity continuous training (LICT). We assessed exercise capacity using peak work rate (Wpeak) and the 6-min walking test (6-MWT). Lung function was evaluated by measuring peak minute ventilation (VE) and the percentage of predicted FEV(1) (FEV(1)pred%). Dyspnea was assessed using the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. Quality of life was measured with the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified (979 subjects). HIIT showed the greatest improvement in Wpeak, 6-MWT, VE, and mMRC compared to usual care (MD 18.48 (95% CI 12.35, 24.60), 67.73 (34.89, 100.57), 6.26 (2.81, 9.72), and -0.53 (-0.89, -0.17), respectively) and showed the improvement in CRQ (MD 10.80 (95% CI 1.65, 19.95)). MICT showed improvement in Wpeak and 6-MWT (MD 18.28 (95% CI 11.20, 25.22), 61.92 (28.34, 95.51)) similar to HICT (MD 16.08 (95% CI 8.19, 23.84), 64.64 (28.70, 100.57)) and showed the highest improvement in CRQ compared to usual care (MD 10.83 (95% CI 1.68, 19.98)). LICT significantly improved Wpeak compared to usual care (MD 13.47 (95% CI 4.77, 22.13)). The quality of evidence for outcomes varied from very low to moderate. CONCLUSION: HIIT and MICT might be optimal training approaches for patients with COPD. LICT exhibited limited clinical efficacy. While HICT was as effective as MICT, it caused more dyspnea.

However, lipid levels fluctuate dynamically, and it is unclear whether there are differences in the association of single-timescale, multiple-timescale, or AIP change trajectories with new-onset cardiovascular disease. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between different AIP parameters and the occurrence of CVD. Data were derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) conducted in 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2020, focusing on middle-aged and elderly populations aged over 45 years. Changes in AIP were classified into three groups using K-means cluster analysis: the low-level growth group (Class 1), the medium-level growth group (Class 2), and the high-level decline group (Class 3). Furthermore, participants were grouped based on tertiles (T) of cumulative AIP (Cum-AIP). Our multivariate logistic regression model integrated adjustments for potential confounders in order to investigate the association between Cum-AIP and the occurrence of CVD. Additionally, we employed restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling to illustrate the dose-response relationship of baseline AIP, mean AIP, and Cum-AIP with CVD risk. During the 5-year follow-up period, 927 participants experienced the onset of CVD. After controlling for various potential confounding factors, it was observed that individuals in Class 2 demonstrated a notably heightened risk of CVD (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.46) and stroke (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.80) in comparison to those in Class 1. However, there was no significant difference in the risk of heart disease (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.48). In contrast, a noteworthy correlation was solely observed in the Class 3 group concerning the risk of stroke occurrence (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.42). The adjusted OR (95% CI) for CVD in the T2 and T3 groups were 1.21 (1.00, 1.46) and 1.30 (1.05, 1.62), respectively, compared to the T1 Cum-AIP group (P for trend = 0.017). Through the RCS model, we identified a positive and linear relationship between baseline AIP, mean AIP, and Cum-AIP with the incidence of CVD. However, the association between baseline AIP and CVD was weak. Sustained elevation of AIP is linked to a heightened risk of CVD in the general population. The elevated mean, and Cum-AIP levels are associated with a heightened risk of CVD. These findings indicate that AIP can serve as a valuable indicator of dyslipidemia, and continuous monitoring and early intervention targeting AIP may contribute to a further reduction in the incidence of CVD.

To this end, we aimed to avoid interaction of Adcitmer with immune cells via Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding. Since glycosylation is essential for FcγR binding, an aglycosylated form of Adcitmer was generated and evaluated on human leukocytes and MCC cell lines using cell death (annexin V/7-aminoactinomycine D) and proliferation (2,3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4Nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5carboxanilide) assays. Finally, the therapeutic performance of Adcitmer and its aglycosylated form was assessed in an MCC xenograft mouse model.Investigating the Adcitmer interaction with immune cells demonstrated that it is mostly mediated by Fc recognition. Accordingly, Adcitmer aglycosylation led to reduced immune cell toxicity and strikingly also to improved therapeutic performance even in an MCC xenograft model using immunodeficient mice.Our study suggests that aglycosylated Adcitmer should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with advanced MCC or other CD56-positive tumors.

However, a new entity has recently emerged: HER2-low, defined as HER2 IHC 1 + or 2 + with negative ISH. HER2-low breast cancer, representing 45-60% of all HER2-negative tumors, has distinct biological characteristics and uncertain responses to conventional HER2-targeted therapies. Recent studies suggest varied clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for further investigation into the impact of HER2-low status on treatment efficacy and prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis evaluates the difference in complete pathological response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) between HER2-low and HER2-zero phenotypes. METHODS: We systematically searched the main databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles evaluating women in neoadjuvant therapy expressing HER2-low and HER2-zero. We computed odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) using DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models for all endpoints, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the heterogeneity using I(2) statistics. R, version 4.2.3, was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: 38 studies totaling 70,104 patients were included. The HER2-low group accounted for 61.3% of patients while HR + status represented 52.4% in the whole research. In 67,839 women, the pCR was analyzed, which in the overall cohort analysis favored the HER2-zero group (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.90; p = 0.000005; I(2) = 15%). Subgroup analyses for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HR + patients also favored HER2-zero expression, with an OR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83-1.0; p < 0.041; I(2) = 12%) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.70-0.81; p < 0.000001; I(2) = 0%), respectively. In the multivariate analysis across all patients, both DFS and OS outcomes were significantly favorable for the HER2-low expression group, with HR 0.8317 (95% CI 0.7036-0.9832; p = 0.031) for DFS and HR 0.806 (95% CI 0.663-0.979; p = 0.03) for OS. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, HER2-zero status is associated with a significantly higher pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared to HER2-low in early-stage breast cancer, and other survival outcomes. These results suggest that HER2-zero should be considered a prognostic factor in early-stage breast cancer and taken into account in neoadjuvant treatment planning and future clinical research.

METHODS: We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism. RESULTS: In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures. INTERPRETATION: The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 251 MIBC patients were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays (TMA). Expression patterns between the tumor front (TF) and center (TC) were compared, and statistical analyses assessed associations with molecular subtypes and clinical parameters. Additionally, 67 matched lymph node metastases and a secondary cohort comprising 16 distant metastases, including seven matched primary tumors, were examined to explore the expression patterns in advanced tumor stages. In primary tumors, HER2 was predominantly negative (83%) but showed higher positivity in the TC. TROP-2 exhibited high overall expression (58% score 3+), while NECTIN4 displayed significant heterogeneity with stronger expression in the TC. Spatial overexpression of TROP-2 and NECTIN4 at the tumor front relative to the tumor center was associated with a better disease free survival. Accurate assessment required four biopsies for HER2 and NECTIN4 and three for TROP-2. HER2 expression was associated with urothelial-like and genomically unstable molecular subtypes, whereas TROP-2 was widely expressed except in the mesenchymal-like subtype. NECTIN4 showed absence of staining in basal, mes-like and Sc/Nec-like subtypes. Paired lymph node metastases showed higher expression scores for all three markers, while distant metastases showed reduced NECTIN4 expression. Additionally, lymph node metastases revealed a considerable heterogeneity for HER2 compared to their matched primary tumors. The spatial heterogeneity of HER2, TROP-2, and NECTIN4 expression necessitates multiple biopsies, particularly from the TC, for accurate evaluation.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of KT on pain intensity, functional status, and quality of life in patients with chronic LE. METHODS: Between February and August 2024, 42 patients (17 females, 25 males; mean age: 44.5 ± 9.1 years; range: 27-61) with chronic LE were included in this single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients were randomized into either the KT or sham-controlled group. Kinesiotaping and sham-taping were applied six times over three weeks. Both groups received recommendations for activity modification and a home-based stretching and strengthening exercise program. Outcome measures were the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score; the Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire (PRFEQ); grip strength; Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH); quality of life in Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the Roles and Maudsley patient satisfaction score. The participants were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment (week three), and four weeks after the end of treatment (week seven). RESULTS: Both groups showed improvements from the baseline in all outcome parameters. At the third and seventh week follow-up, KT was superior to sham-taping in all outcome measures, except for two SF-36 subscales, with effect sizes further supporting the clinical relevance of these findings by indicating meaningful differences in favor of KT. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that KT using the epidermis, dermis, fascia (EDF), and muscle inhibition technique effectively reduces pain, improves disability and quality of life, and achieves high patient satisfaction levels without any adverse effects in LE.

Central to this process are epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, which regulate gene expression and contribute to aging-related epigenetic drift. This drift is characterized by global hypomethylation and localized hypermethylation, impacting genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. Simultaneously, mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of aging, manifests as impaired oxidative phosphorylation, excessive reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial DNA mutations, driving oxidative stress and cellular senescence. Emerging evidence highlights a bidirectional interplay between epigenetics and mitochondrial function. DNA methylation modulates the expression of nuclear genes governing mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control, while mitochondrial metabolites, such as acetyl-CoA and S-adenosylmethionine, reciprocally influence epigenetic landscapes.

METHODS: This ex vivo comparative study of porcine specimens assessed five imaging protocols with both CBCT and PCD-CT at three effective radiation dose levels (high: 360µSv, standard: 145µSv, low: 20µSv) to evaluate image quality, artifact burden, metal artifact susceptibility, and quantitative bone measurements in the mandibular region. Three blinded readers analyzed the data using a 5-point Likert scale (5 = highest to 1 = lowest rating) and performed linear bone measurements at implant planning sites. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and inter-reader reliability assessment using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: Each reader evaluated 30 data sets (12 CBCT, 18 PCD-CT), with 24 implant planning sites per imaging protocol. High-dose PCD-CT demonstrated the best image quality and diagnostic interpretability (4.89 ± 0.27), followed by standard-dose PCD-CT and CBCT (4.50 ± 0.73; 4.33 ± 0.61), with low-dose protocols showing intermediate quality with higher artifact burden. In comparison to CBCT, PCD-CT demonstrated superior performance in reducing implant-induced artifacts across all protocols. Quantitative bone measurements showed minimal variability, meeting clinical precision requirements for computer-assisted implant surgery. Both qualitative (ICCs:0.70-0.89; p < 0.001) and quantitative (ICCs:0.79-1; p < 0.001) analyses demonstrated high reliability, regardless of the reader's experience. CONCLUSIONS: PCD-CT demonstrated superior image quality and reduced artifacts compared with CBCT at all radiation dose levels. These findings highlight PCD-CT's potential to enhance implant planning and improve clinical outcomes with reduced radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A triple-blind clinical trial was conducted with 30 participants diagnosed with periodontitis, randomized into 3 groups: (1) coconut oil, (2) chlorhexidine and (3) placebo. Saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected before treatment, one month after treatment, and one month post-non-surgical periodontal therapy. Bacterial DNA was extracted, and the V3-V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technologies. Inflammatory biomarkers, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were quantified from GCF samples. RESULTS: Coconut oil treatment significantly reduced pathogenic bacterial families such as Spirochaetaceae and Tannerellaceae while promoting beneficial bacteria such as Streptococcaceae. At the genus and species levels, coconut oil reduced pathogens such as Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola along with increase in beneficial bacteria such as Streptococcus. The subgingival microbial dysbiosis index improved significantly in both coconut oil and chlorhexidine groups. Furthermore, the coconut oil demonstrated a reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α levels, indicating decreased local inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Coconut oil treatment significantly modulated the oral microbiome and reduced inflammatory markers in patients with periodontitis, suggesting its potential as a natural and effective adjunct in periodontal therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study highlights coconut oil's potential as a natural adjunct in periodontal therapy, effectively reducing pathogenic bacteria and inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α). It offers a safe alternative to chlorhexidine, promoting microbiome balance and improved periodontal health. ",Clinical oral investigations,

METHODS: We included all adults admitted to the MS center of Marseille for ION between March 2016 and April 2024, with CSF analysis including the kappa free light chain (K-FLC) index. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to measure the diagnostic ability of the K-FLC index. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-seven adults were admitted for ION; 210 (93%) had a K-FLC index measurement. MS was diagnosed in 84 (40%); clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS in 77 (36.5%), including 20 with future conversion to MS (CISwc); MOGAD in 26 (12.5%); NMOSD in 13 (6%); and other inflammatory disorders in 10 (5%). A K-FLC index ≥6.7 differentiated MS/CISwc from other diagnoses with specificity 86% and sensitivity 95% (area under the curve [AUC] 0.94). A K-FLC index <4.9 differentiated MOGAD from other diagnoses with specificity 63% and sensitivity 92% (AUC 0.78) and MOGAD from MS/CISwc with specificity 96% and sensitivity 92% (AUC 0.97). Among all patients, 93 (44%) had a K-FLC index <4.9: 24 of these (26%) had MOGAD and 5 (5.5%) MS/CISwc. Among the remaining patients with a K-FLC index ≥4.9 (n = 117), 2 (1.7%) had MOGAD (K-FLC index of 7.9 and 16.2) and 99 (85%) MS/CISwc. Among patients with normal MRI (n = 96), 73 (76%) had a K-FLC index <4.9: 22 of these (30%) had MOGAD, and none showed conversion to MS. Among the remaining patients with a K-FLC index ≥4.9 (n = 23), 2 (8.5%) had MOGAD and 7 (30.5%) showed conversion to MS. The K-FLC index did not differentiate NMOSD from other diagnoses and only moderately differentiated NMO from MS/CISwc (AUC 0.80). DISCUSSION: The K-FLC index is an accessible biomarker to guide early diagnosis in patients with ION. The probability of MOGAD in patients with ION and a K-FLC index ≥4.9 is low even in case of normal brain/spinal cord MRI. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with ION, the K-FLC index can distinguish between MS/CISwc and MOGAD.

We investigated whether sex hormone-related factors influence progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in women with MS over a long-term follow-up. METHODS: The study analysed 1210 female MS patients from the San Raffaele MS Center using data from an environmental survey (2019-2023). PIRA was defined as 12-week confirmed disability progression independent of recent relapses (<30 days). Cox proportional-hazard models (adjusted for confounding factors) were used to assess the effect of hormone-related factors on PIRA risk. RESULTS: Patients who used oral contraceptives before MS diagnosis had a 26% lower risk of PIRA and a delayed median time to the first PIRA event (9.94 vs 7.5 years; HR=0.74; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.89; p=0.0018). Conversely, menopause at diagnosis (HR=1.82; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.67; p=0.0022) and pregnancy before diagnosis (HR=1.22; 95% CI 1.006 to 1.47; p=0.043) were associated with a shorter time to PIRA. No significant differences were found with abortion, menstrual irregularity or fertility therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that early oral contraceptives may delay future disability progression, supporting the importance of sex hormones in MS and prompting further prospective investigations on oral contraceptives to slow disease progression.

However, recent studies have revealed that lactate plays a much more dynamic role, acting as an immune signaling molecule that influences cellular communication, through the process of ""lactate shuttling."" Lactylation, a novel post-translational modification, is directly derived from lactate and represents an emerging mechanism through which lactate exerts its effects on cellular function. It has been shown to directly affect immune cells by modulating the activation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. This modification influences the expression of key immune-related genes, thereby impacting immune cell differentiation, cytokine production, and overall immune response. In this review, we focused on the role of lactate and lactylation in the dysregulation of immune responses in psoriasis and its relapse. Additionally, we discuss the potential applications of targeting lactate metabolism and lactylation modifications in the treatment of psoriasis, alongside the investigation of artificial intelligence applications in advancing lactate and lactylation-focused drug development, identifying therapeutic targets, and enabling personalized medical decision-making. The significance of this review lies in its comprehensive exploration of how lactate and lactylation contribute to immune dysregulation, offering a novel perspective for understanding the metabolic and epigenetic changes associated with psoriasis. By identifying the roles of these pathways in modulating immune responses, this review provides a foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies that target these mechanisms.

Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor, has shown promise in treating HLH and exerts synergistic effects when combined with dexamethasone. Our pilot study preliminarily demonstrated that the combination of ruxolitinib and dexamethasone (the Ru-D regimen) had a high response rate and led to favorable short-term survival outcomes in adult HLH patients. In this prospective phase 2 clinical trial, we propose the Ru-D regimen as a first-line treatment for adults newly diagnosed with HLH with unknown triggers (chictr.org.cn identifier: ChiCTR2100049996). A total of 28 Chinese patients were enrolled, and the median follow-up time was 25.1 months (range, 0.87-34.0). The 2-month OS rate (the primary endpoint) was 85.7%, which exceeded our expected 2-month OS rate of 75%. The 6-month and 2-year OS rates were 67.9% (19/28) and 53.6% (15/28), respectively. The median OS of lymphoma-associated HLH (LAHS) patients was 5.8 months, and most of these patients had NK/T-cell lymphoma. In contrast, the 2-year OS rate of non-LAHS patients was 75%. The overall response rate (ORR) was 85.7% (24/28); 17.9% (5/28) of patients achieved a complete response (CR) during the Ru-D regimen. Overall, the Ru-D regimen was well tolerated in HLH patients.

This study employed the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index as a measure of insulin resistance to investigate its relationship with PSD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2018). PSD was assessed using data from patient health questionnaires, while the TyG index was calculated based on fasting venous blood glucose and fasting triglyceride levels. The formula used for the TyG index is ln[triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting blood glucose (mg/dL)/2]. Participants were categorized into four groups according to the TyG index quartiles. A weighted multivariable logistic regression model was applied to examine the relationship between the TyG index and PSD. RESULTS: A total of 1217 patients were included in the study, of which 232 were diagnosed with PSD. The TyG index was divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4) for analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found a significant positive association between the highest quartile of the TyG index (Q4: ≥9.33) and PSD (OR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.04-6.07, p = 0.041). This suggests that in the U.S. adult stroke population, individuals with higher TyG indices are more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Subgroup analysis further confirmed a stable and independent positive association between the TyG index and PSD (all trend p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this large cross-sectional study, our results suggest that among US adults who have experienced a stroke, those with higher TyG index levels are more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. This provides a novel approach for the clinical prevention of PSD. Patients with higher TyG indices in the stroke population may require closer psychological health monitoring and timely intervention. Additionally, since the TyG index is calculated using only fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels, it can help identify high-risk PSD patients, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources.

Here we show that striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on mouse dopamine axons interrupt this relationship. After nAChR-mediated depolarization, dopamine release by subsequent depolarization events was suppressed for ~100 ms. This suppression was not due to depletion of dopamine or acetylcholine, but to a limited reactivation of dopamine axons after nAChR-mediated depolarization, and is more prominent in dorsal than in ventral striatum. In vivo, nAChRs predominantly depressed dopamine release, as nAChR antagonism in dorsal striatum elevated dopamine detected with optic-fiber photometry of dopamine sensor GRAB(DA2m) and promoted conditioned place preference. Our findings reveal that ChIs acting via nAChRs transiently limit the reactivation of dopamine axons for subsequent action potentials in dopamine neurons and therefore generate a dynamic inverse scaling of dopamine release according to ChI activity.

Here we examined the protective effects of a thioredoxin-mimetic peptide CB13 (TXM-CB13), known for its antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory properties. We examined the effects of TXM-CB13 on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RAW264.7 macrophages. TXM-CB13 appeared to alleviate symptoms of DSS-induced colitis and to significantly suppress the protein and mRNA levels of NLRP3, Mlck, and IL-1β in colonic tissues. Additionally, TXM-CB13 treatment increased the levels of the intestinal barrier proteins Occludin, ZO-1, and NLRP1, as shown through immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In vitro, TXM-CB13 inhibited LPS-induced TLR4 signaling, reducing MyD88 levels and consequently attenuating the activation of the NF-κB pathways, including p-IκB-α/IκB-α and p-NF-κB-p65/NF-κB-p65. This inhibition further reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome components, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, GSDMD, and IL-1β. In addition, TXM-CB13 prevented the ROS-mediated dissociation of TXNIP from TRX, inhibiting NLRP3 activation.

The first entering the plateau can induce sleep disorders in individuals, primarily attributed to insufficient oxygen supply. This study used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to better understand the molecular mechanism of acute hypoxia-induced sleep disorders. The Drosophila activity monitoring system (DAMS) was employed to observe the sleep-wake in adult (w(1118), sima(KG07607), and clock(jrk)) female flies. Quantifying the relative mRNA expression levels of sima and circadian clock genes in the head of flies was accomplished by utilizing qRT-PCR. Acute hypoxia caused sleep disorders in w(1118) flies, such as shortened sleep duration and length, and prolonged sleep latency. PCR results showed that sima and clock genes were up-regulated in ZT6 and ZT12 and down-regulated in ZT0 and ZT18 in acute hypoxic w(1118) flies compared to normoxic w(1118) flies. Under normoxic conditions, sleep indexes in sima(KG07607) flies were not substantially different from w(1118) flies. However, clock(jrk) flies demonstrated a reduced sleep duration, decreased sleep bout length, and increased sleep latency and activities. Sleep and gene expression in sima(KG07607) flies under acute hypoxic conditions were not significantly different from those under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly, sleep and gene expression in clock(jrk) flies showed opposite trends to w(1118) flies. The present study indicates that acute hypoxia disrupt circadian rhythms through the activation of sima/HIF-1α, leading to the onset of sleep disorders, with Clock signaling potentially serving as a contributing factor.

Few studies have explored the impact of long-term rate control therapy on levels of troponin in AF patients without coronary heart disease and heart failure. This substudy of the RATe control in Atrial Fibrillation (RATAF) II study aimed to compare the effects of six months' treatment with diltiazem and metoprolol on hs-troponin I (TnI) levels both at rest and during exercise testing in patients with permanent AF. METHODS: This was a parallel-group, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial. The cohort consisted of 93 patients (28 women, mean age 71 ± 7 years) with symptomatic, permanent AF with preserved left ventricular systolic function and no coronary heart disease. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either diltiazem 360 mg (n = 49) or metoprolol 100 mg (n = 44) once daily for six months. Blood tests were drawn at rest and during peak exercise testing at baseline, one month and six months' treatment. This research has been supported by grants from the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and Vestre Viken Hospital Trust. RESULTS: Six months' treatment with diltiazem and metoprolol significantly lowered the heart rate at rest and peak exercise.
